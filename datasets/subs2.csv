Looking for Costa Rican Spanish speakers for an online study on speech perception and production,"hey guys! i'm a linguistics phd student and i'm doing a study over speech perception and production for native spanish speakers living in costa_rica who have studied or learned english (you don't have to be an expert or anything, only understand it at a basic level). the study is over how speech sounds are produced and perceived across different languages. it's totally on-line, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and you will receive $6 usd via paypal or western union once you've finished!

if you would like to participate, or know someone in costa_rica who would like to participate, send me a message, leave a comment here in this thread, or follow the qr code listed below! thanks!! :)

Traveling to CR as a tica...,"hi! i am costa_rican-american but have never been to costa_rica (or latin america at all, for that matter). although my spanish isn't completely fluent, i spoke it at home growing up, so i use some tiquismos and have the accent a little (the ""r"" lol). 

i've had an urge for a while now to visit cr and try to connect better with my heritage. are there any tips for first timers? or even others who were in a similar situation? maybe other latinos from the us who have traveled there who can share their perspectives? 

i am also not very well traveled, so i have a little anxiety about being somewhere new for the first time. i believe i have distant family still in the country, but don't have a way of contacting them or anything, so i'd be on my own in that sense. i do plan on going with my partner, who doesn't speak spanish at all. any insights are welcome, thanks! :)",0,167

How much time to get through check-in and airport security on a Saturday?,"flying out tomorrow 12:35 pm. how much earlier should we arrive at the airport? 2 hours? what is the average time usually from arriving at the airport to make it to boarding?

we are coming from puntarenas. travel time by car is 75 minutes, but i like to give extra time. of course not everybody agrees in the group when we should leave...

edit: the car trip was 30 minutes longer than expected, but other than that it was smooth sailing. we used adobe car rental (2 miles from airport) so we gased the car up, dropped it off and their bus was there in 10 minutes or so. 

from the outside of the airport to the gate it took 45 minutes. 20-20 luggage check at spirit and security and 5 minutes walk to the gate. we ate at avokato because we got hungry although we didn't plan on that.

thanks for everyone for the responses, i know we got lucky with traffic and everything, but i had to fight group decision.",0,172
My Parting Tribute to Costa Rica,"pura vida costa_rica,

i'm here to write to you and express my sincerest thanks for my experience in your amazing country. i want to express to you what i think makes the country particularly special within the global climate which i hope serves as a rallying cry for the values which i think are in rarified air.

but before i do that, i'd like to share a little piece on how i came to the country and why i'm leaving it for now. several years ago, i met the first woman i ever loved. as it turned out, she was costa_rican and i decided after some time to try and make a go of things in costa_rica -- previously i had been put off as i was preferring cheaper pastures. that said, i made the move and eventually i came to love the country and the woman. however, years later we've decided to split up and she's kind of taken a hardline stance on me not patrolling the small country as we may bump in to each other. do i think it's immature and selfish? a little bit for sure. it's pretty unreasonable to ask me to abandon the life i've built and the attachment i have to the country i love, but i'm someone who prefers not to have any drama or problems, and short of that i can see her point of view, and would prefer to avoid the advent of either one of us seeing the other with another person until considerable time has passed and the pain has subsided.

with that backstory i can say my farewell for now and in doing so, talk about what i love about costa_rica:

\- cr is a latin american country but not one with all of the typical ailments. for starters, your police force is truly friendly (albeit at times inept) compared to other latin american counterparts. when i see a cop i don't have to worry like when i'm in mexico, fearing a shakedown or exploitation. whether i had done some sort of minor violation or they were just doing a routine check, they were always reasonable about it. i actually felt more safe around costa_rican police than in my home country which shall remain unnamed :).

\- ticos have an amazing sense of humour. i was here across the pandemic and had absolutely nothing to do at one point so i temporarily picked up the nasty habit of tik tok. but no regrets with that decision as i'm proud to report costa_rican tiktok is truly world class. it doesn't matter if it's a prepared joke or just some guy trying to cross a river during rainy season, the commentary is hilarious and ya'll are in a class of your own. i'd also like to note it had always been my experience that ya'll were funny in person, but i guess i didn't put two and two together realizing how much funnier you were until i could readily compare you against other countries' tiktoks using a vpn during the pandemic (ya like i said, i had extra time on my hands). i predict an amazing comedian will come out of costa_rica in the next decade.

\- ticos are super helpful. there is a special thing that happens when you get your car stuck, all of a sudden there are 12 ticos there and a 12 pack of pilsen or imperial. no, i'm not going to choose one over the other, i think imperial is better for micheladas though. moving on, i always appreciated the informal roadside assistance i received.

\- you kept your borders open during the pandemic. now it may have been for economic reasons, but i assure you that socially this was ultra beneficial compared to the alternative. please stand by this value of upholding freedom (even if it is in part sponsored by an over-reliance on tourism).

\- ticas are absolutely stunning and i'm totally jealous.  not only that, there's a ton of them, there seems to be an abundance of beautiful, single women. praise god ticos, ya'll are lucky.

\- costa_ricans are polite. i have always appreciated this aspect of the country. politeness is valued, there's a certain warm charm here that while maybe not as overtly outward as say colombia where people like grab you and start dancing, is still quite genuine and refreshing. i love talking to costa_rican moms and grandmas, they are sweet.

\- costa_rica has a generally intelligent population capable of discussing a variety of topics with ease. now i'm assuming some people are somehow going to get offended by this for whatever reason, but let me just say this isn't a given in every country. my home country has difficulty discussing political issues for example as people tend to get pretty aggressive, filled with self-righteous indignation, and defensive, that wasn't my experience when talking to costa_ricans. i could assert my own views and they were often dealt with diplomatically if even not agreed with (even people say what a crazy dude after i leave). conversely, it just seemed like most people were fairly politically conscientious and that people are willing to hit the streets for something they believe in. i recall the demonstrations across the pandemic where costa_ricans were demonstrating against a seemingly absurd rate hike in property taxes and an unprecedented tax for removing your money from the bank. congratulations costa_rica, protesting and affecting change as one country is a vital democratic process, do not take this for granted and continue to celebrate it even if you don't agree with the particular reason for the protest. my country has a recent history of shutting down protests through illegal force.

\- it goes to show how much i actually love costa_rica that i put this so far down the list but obviously, and clearly, your nature and protection thereof is absolutely outstanding. all of the mountains, beaches, rivers, jungles, fresh water -- it's right in the name -- rica. your country is rich in nature, protect it at all costs and continue to boot out mining scum who want to exploit you. watch out for the ""illegal mining"" narrative that is simply trying to act like only ""legitimate mining"" can protect you from this. it's a sham narrative that my home country would stupidly fall for.

\- i like the traditional costa_rican finca accent and saying ""costa shhhrica"".

\- there is no military and that contributes to a peaceful disposition. this is a rarity in the world, and it was courageous step to take in favour of focusing on healthcare and education. it absolutely has helped costa_rica to develop more of a middle class over its counterparts despite being one of the last to join trade agreements and thus be subject to more unfair stipulations. never the less, it appears costa_rica is taking center stage as a latin american innovator.

\- you had a civil war / disagreement between grande mexico and the now costa_rica which someone won and yet you can't tell the winners apart from the losers. this is an absolute rarity, in fact i've never heard someone discuss this at all. look how divided the north and south sections of the us are ideologically, yet here in costa_rica there is no apparent winner or loser -- there is no faction that can be readily identified as having been for ""grande mexico"" and i don't think that's because you killed them all (hopefully i'm right). rather it seems because of the principal of amnesty. yes, i acknowledge i avoided the subject of the seeming divide between annexed and og cr parts as well as the forgotten land of limon. that said, there is still a high degree of unity in costa_rica compared to other countries.

\- i love the amount of good djs. yaya, this new house trend that seeks to form a snobby upper class through music that looks down on reggaeton is pretty annoying to me but i digress. -- there's really good djs in costa_rica who do a nice blend of reggaeton, dancehall, reggae, afrobeats, house and the like.

and with that, i say to you, some of the things i've loved about costa_rica and hold near and dear to this day. to any tico or tica idealizing the lands beyond your border just let me say that in my experience costa_rica is special. if you insist on holding something to an elevated status elsewhere and you think it's something you can't find in costa_rica then by all means go ahead and explore, but i think you'll come to find in time that costa_rica is in a bit of a golden age and a goldilocks zone (even historically you guys were just enough out of the reach of both grande mexico and grande colombia). surprise surprise the least f\*cked with central american country also seems to enjoy the best ""karma"" for lack of a better term. not without its limitations and its problems sure, but that can be said of any country, the general thing of importance is the foundation and the trajectory. 

with all of that being said thanks so much for my time in your country and look forward to seeing ya'll again.

Best Places to Practice Spanish,"hello all!

i‚Äôm planning on going on a 10 day trip with my family (all adults and teenagers) to costa_rica in mid july. we would like to stay in an area that‚Äôs a bit out of the way without a ton of tourists everywhere, but not so out of the way that there‚Äôs not much to do and it feels totally deserted. 

additionally, although i‚Äôm not totally fluent, i speak spanish pretty well and am really excited about being able to practice my spanish with natives in a spanish-speaking country. for that reason, i was looking to stay somewhere that, save some tourists, is predominately spanish speaking where people wouldn‚Äôt instantly switch into english upon seeing someone who‚Äôs not a local as i heard is common in big tourist areas like la_fortuna and manuel antonio. 

i realize that spanish is much more common in areas of the country where fewer tourists go, which tend to to be the less interesting places (at least in the eyes of foreigners), but was wondering if anyone could recommend places to stay that are mostly spanish-speaking but still have some interesting things to do and aren‚Äôt so underdeveloped and out of the way that it‚Äôs a major inconvenience for travelers.

i was thinking of flying into liberia and staying around playas del coco/playa hermosa (guanacaste) which seem (correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) to have nice beaches and restaurants and a decently developed city and don‚Äôt seem as completely overrun by english speaking tourists as somewhere like manuel antonio. i was then thinking of making some day trips to some more remote locations and national parks and one multi-day trip to la_fortuna from this ‚Äúbase.‚Äù i am totally open to new plans if anyone could recommend some better locations, though.

any recommendations for other areas to stay that are better suited to what i‚Äôm looking for or general advice would be greatly appreciated!

i am really into nature and wildlife so i'm more interested in access to lush rainforests and good hikes than beaches and parties (though i enjoy those too once in a while). i'll also need to be close to amenities and transportation as i don't drive

last time i visited i stayed mostly in escazu, but i'm considering maybe moving around the country, staying at airbnbs in different places for a few months at a time

i was thinking of a few months in la_fortuna,  monteverde, and also potentially uvita and corcovado. is there anywhere else that should (or shouldn't) be on my list?

and advice would be much appreciated",0,145

Nosara or Samara in Jan with young kids?,"i‚Äôm flip flopping. 

fam of 4. my kids will be 6 and 4. plan to stay at one of these spots for a week. 

we don‚Äôt surf. though i like the idea of trying! i‚Äôve done it once before. can‚Äôt say my kids will give it much of a try. if anything the little one might be more interested. he‚Äôs not a strong swimmer yet so i don‚Äôt know if i should even try with him. 

aside from that what‚Äôs best for a young family? 

things that are important: 
- variety of restaurants within walking distance
- beach good for playing in sand/ waves. probably won‚Äôt full on swim. shade would be nice 
- accommodation within walking distance to beach and restaurants that also have a pool. 
- we would all love to see turtles in ostional if timing works out. not sure this is possible if staying in samara as i‚Äôve read not to drive there when it‚Äôs dark, yet you have to be there at dusk/dawn to see them. 

this is a one off trip for us. we are prepared to spend money for convenience, good food and comfort within reason.  

open to suggestions on where specifically to stay. i‚Äôm looking on airbnb so far.

trip advice: itinerary for late-June,"i have been staying in costa_rica on a study abroad for the past few months. this country has blown my mind in terms of culture, hospitality, biodiversity, etc. i have spent the majority of my time in monteverde, but also spent time up and down the pacific slope. i know it will be a bit rainy in june, but no worries.

i will have two weeks before returning home and want advice! one week is solo, and i have no plans yet. the other week is with my boyfriend. i want to give him the best experience. we both have an intermediate level spanish.

i have not visited the caribbean side and was considering doing so during my week solo. thoughts?

during the week with my partner, i was planning the following -
monteverde -> bijagua (rio celeste, volc√°n tenorio) -> quepos (manuel antonio park) -> playa jaco or playa hermosa

generally i am looking for a volcano that is less touristy. a friend recommended tenorio, but it seems most people only go for rio celeste? i think we‚Äôd be interested a good bit of hiking at a volcano or the tenorio craters. i also have not visited the central coast, hence manuel antonio reserve. would this be a good choice? i have been to santa rosa and a few in monteverde. overall, i feel like this is a lot in transportation expenses and/or time in a bus. but i can‚Äôt tell; maybe it‚Äôs better to rent a manuel car (?).

we're having a hard time picking where to go since we've never gone. we don't want the most touristy place, but we need somewhere with good internet. we're not big into nightlife, but it would be nice to have a few restaurants/bars/cafes (nothing fancy, a fish shack is actually preferred haha). we're beginner surfers, so decent and not-too-big waves in august would be great. having great nature around is also a must, we'd love to do some hiking and see monkeys and stuff. last but not least, not sure if important, but we both speak spanish, so communicating with locals isn't a problem.

"5 days in Tamarindo, Costa Rica","we arrived on a wednesday and stayed 2 days at the zulu surf hotel. zulu rooms were nice, clean and spacious. the room has a small kitchenette with a microwave and fridge. the property has a purified water machine and offered tea and coffee. the free breakfast from sol bakery was top of the list on one of the best places we ate while in tamarindo. the only thing was missing was a swimming pool. but other than that the hotel was located in the heart of things and convenient. 

    we did an atv excursion with 506 adventures the ride was slow but the atv‚Äôs were new and comfortable. we stopped at 2 beautiful beaches along the way. we also did a white water raft excursion with teriono adventures and the experience was great. 

   we stayed 3 days at the jardin eden boutique hotel adults only and it was peaceful. the rooms comes with robe, slippers, tv, ac , fridge and a balcony with seating. the only missing was a microwave. jardin offered free breakfast, dinner and one meal at a restaurant off the property. the private beach is a mini hike with a small pool, chairs, bar, and grill all on a patch of grass at the beach. the vibe at both the beach and the pool was very quiet needed some jazz tunes at the pool and costa_rica party tunes going at the beach. but i would recommend the stay. 

we used tropical tour shuttles for private transportation and it was well worth it. 

tamarindo isn‚Äôt the party town you would expect. things seem to die down quick. but if your looking to stay in the heart of what‚Äôs considered a party zulu surf is the perfect place. 

we dined at pangas please wear close toe shoe to be prepared for the crabs running around under the table and across your feet. this place could‚Äôve used some soft music to set the mood because personally it had no ambiance. but the food was good.

chiquita bar great night vibe on a sunday and we‚Äôll crafted drinks.

i was born in the us but my parents migrated from cr and most my family is still in cr. i have visited them several times my whole life. i‚Äôm considering moving to cr (i have dual citizenship) as i feel like the us is just going downhill. i‚Äôm too stressed here. nothing is working out for me, etc. it‚Äôs a really big decision to make though. i have a dog that i would take with me and probably my lizard (bearded dragon). 

i have a masters degree in microbiology and i was laid off in january. i‚Äôm having a really hard time finding a job and i feel like my education and experience is not valued as much as it would be valued in cr. i lived with my family there for 2 months a couple years ago and i was more calm. i have really bad anxiety and the rat race that happens here is probably so bad for my mental and physical health. 

has anyone made this decision? whether from us or any other country. what were their steps? did they have animals they brought? 

anyone in cr know how well my education and experience would be there? would i successfully be able to secure a job? 

i‚Äôve been thinking about this for months now. i really want to consider this option before making it. i don‚Äôt want to put my dog and lizard through the move if it‚Äôs just a dumb idea.",0,248

Advice on where to stay,"hi there!
im (25f) to be traveling with a group of 3 other females for our first time to cr in sept. we plan on renting an suv & trying to break up the week long stay between la_fortuna, montezuma, and manuel antonio. we want to try to get to see the staples, as in volcanos/hot springs, beaches of course, and national parks. 
i‚Äôve been looking at air bnbs and vrbo stays and there‚Äôs sooo many reasonably priced and beautiful places. but in the past i‚Äôve regretted picking a beautiful place over somewhere i could‚Äôve soaked up a more enriched experience. i‚Äôve also considered that maybe hostels would be a good option for a couple days to get to know locals, i just don‚Äôt know where to look for hose.

"Recommendations for a US bank to switch to that will have better service (than Wells Fargo) in Costa Rica (San Jose/Alajuela,)","i'm an american who until recently was happy with wells fargo. back in february i was robbed in medellin colombia and the thieves got access to my banking login. wells fargo locked me out and refused to help me regain access unless i go into a branch with my drivers license (which was also stolen) and passport. i'm actually just thinking about leaving wf and switching to a different bank because they've been unwilling to assist me. my ex wife has also remained on my account and had full access to my money for a while now. they also refused to remove her unless the two of us show up together at a branch...which is impossible because she lives in the midwest and i live in va.

i currently live in alajuela and was wondering if anyone could recommend another us based bank that i could get an account with and use, potentially one with a branch or better services internationally, specifically in cr. i'm working on establishing residence there but just can't wait. i need to be able to access my online banking.

Does the Costa Rican migration office require nationals to have a certain amount of money in order to leave the country?,"i was told that in order for someone who is a cr citizen to return to the us from an emergency travel pass (given while change of status is being adjusted due to family emergency), that even with this pass they cannot return/leave the country without showing they have a large sum of money in their possession. they also hinted that they might even be made to pay a ""fee"" depending on the official and have been told about the different kinds of corruption like this going on in many areas of costa_rica. but when i try to find more information on this, i cannot. it keeps bringing me to information about the $30 exit fees, which is not what i'm trying to get information about.

Itinerary for 11 days in September/October?,"my boyfriend and i are traveling to costa_rica for 11 days in late september/early october, flying in and out of san_jose! i know this is rainy season, so trying to figure out what the best itinerary / cities to go to would be.

here is what we are currently thinking:

day 1 - fly into san_jose around 12pm, immediately travel to monteverde

day 2 - monteverde cloud forest hiking / zip lining

day 3 - travel to la_fortuna

day 4 - arenal volcano/la_fortuna waterfall/hot springs

day 5 - travel to tortuguero

day 6 - tortuguero national park

day 7 - travel to puerto viejo (or cahuita or manzanillo)

day 8 - cahuita national park

day 9 - pacuare river 2 day hike/paddle trip

day 10 - pacuare river 2 day hike/paddle trip, get back to san_jose

day 11 - 1pm flight out of san_jose


obviously, we would do more on our travel days then just travel (ideally) but you get the vibe. should we cut out monteverde and add a day in each other city? is our timing okay on any of the cities? any advice on the itinerary, recommended tours and attractions, or any other recommendations for things to do or places to eat, are highly appreciated!!",0,250

Harrasment won't be tolerated in this subreddit against any local or foreigner,"#dear visitors

even our whole community is not even 1% of our country, and it's not all the community that is being a troll, please don't interpret this as our country not being friendly

if you are here as a visitor please be respectful

if you are a local, please be respectful

let's clear it up, expats are immigrants, but still also expats, a foreigner should introduce themselves to someone from their same country as an expat, and should introduce themselves to someone from a different country as an immigrant. 

do they do it? that's a different thing and out of our hands and we are not the vocabulary police. 

we are also not the gentrification police, you want things changed? be vocal with our government, harassing people on reddit doesn't change laws. 

this post is the official announcement and rules will be updated.

edit to add: the whole mod team here is costarican so stop building strawman arguments.

#some have taken this message out of context so let's be clear

you **can** still discuss and complain about gentrification, you **cannot** attack someone out of the blue and tell them ""don't come here, f you, stay in your country, we don't want you"" just for asking about living here. 

you **can** call expats immigrants cause they are, you can call them gringos too, you cannot call them sex tourists, drug addicts, or anything else that has no context other than just being from the us or visiting jaco. 

and we, just as always, will also make sure no one can be abusive towards locals either, we don't publish a log of bans or removals because that's silly but we do remove many because a-hole tourists do exist and have treated locals badly in our sub.

what we are asking is that you don't assume all these things and attack first based on nothing, we don't care what you've heard they treat foreigners in their country like, the user you're talking to has probably not, and the ones who have don't represent a whole country, just like the trolls we have here don't represent our country either.

disregarding these rules means you can be temporarily or permanently banned, whichever side you're on local or foreign we don't care, just don't be a dick.",0,382

Arenal area La Fortuna tips,"we wrapped up a 3 night trip to la_fortuna on april 1st.
we drove from manual antonio (ma) to arenal and it took us about 5.5 hours with a short stop. if you want to learn some quick tips about ma please look at my other post. https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/1276xji/costarica_manuel_antonio_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

where we stayed:
- we stayed at the jungle beach lodge:
the place was clean, had a beautiful view, pool, and offered a good free breakfast.
the hotel was a literally a 3 minute walk from the waterfall, it had simple clean rooms and good service. for folks looking for a simple lodging with breakfast i would highly recommend this hotel.
tip: 
we asked for the 7am breakfast as we preferred to get up early and out the door. they pack up the breakfast to go if requested.

-arenal volcano trek and mystico hanging bridges:

planning tip: 
we coupled the arenal trek and the mystico hanging bridges for the same day to save time, and gas. both of these attractions are close to each other. we finished the arenal trek, grabbed a quick bite and then did the mystico hanging bridges. both of these activities involve quite a bit of walking so this approach may not work for everyone. 

arenal volcano trek: 
once you arrive at the park entrance, pay for your tickets. you don‚Äôt need to take a pic of their map from the park office. there is a better updated map at the starting point of the trek.
we have a 8 year old daughter and we did this together. this should give folks an idea about difficulty.
if you want to do sector 4 - las coladas (yellow line to old lava flow) or sectors 5 - el ceibo(red line to the ceibo tree) proceed to parking lot two. the trek starts from that lot.
the look out at the end of sector 4 is totally worth it. you see the volcano on one‚Äôs side and the lake on the other. it‚Äôs breathtaking.
tip:
sector 5 is very muddy. please wear appropriate shoes and clothing. i would take a light rain jackets just in case, snacks and water. doing the additional km‚Äôs on sector 5 was worth it for us. the tree alone is massive, it‚Äôs span, it‚Äôs root system was worth the extra calories we burnt :).
we personally didn‚Äôt use a guide. we used one in manuel antonio, how ever we wanted to do this trek at our own pace and needed to be able to increase our speed if needed to complete it faster.
total trek was approx 5 km‚Äôs. 

mystico hanging bridges
we had lunch at the restaurant inside the park. the view from the restaurant was amazing, and the food was excellent including the fresh fruit juices.

the main trail with the bridges takes about 1.5 hours.

tip: 
this may seem obvious but please use the bathroom before you start the trail. there are no bathrooms until you wrap up the trails.
the longer hanging bridges are high and can shake a lot if there are lots of people on them at the same time (max 15 people). we preferred to wait a bit and get on the bridges when there were less people. the shaking doesn‚Äôt suit everyone and certainly not me who is a bit afraid of heights.

la_fortuna waterfall 
there is free parking upfront. we found the parking lot not very busy from 8.00-11.00 am. there are approx 500 steps down and up. our 8 year old handled this with some breaks in between.

tip:
take water shoes, rain coats and or ponchos as it rains often.
take a rash guard as the water is very cold. once you get in it‚Äôs so refreshing. 
it‚Äôs about 16 feet deep in the main waterfall area, there is a nice little river area on the side where most people rest up and swim. lots of fish are there and the kids love it.

hot springs
we went to the titoku hot springs. the reason we chose this spring was due to  less crowds, and as it less touristy. it‚Äôs very small they have about 6 hot springs plus 1 cold spring. when we were there there were two other families.
i wouldn‚Äôt recommend titoku for families and on hindsight i feel we should have gone to baldi which is right next door.
this place is small, there was nothing for the kids to do apart from resting in the hot springs, there were limited sun beds so there was no place for us to launge around unless we wanted to sit on chairs.
the service at the reception and at the bar was great.

restaurants and coffee houses:
-el coloso arenal restaurant:
this is a small restaurant focused on local food. they have tons of other options too.
the food was very tasteful, and the prices were excellent.
we tried the small sized nachos with beef, which were great and enough for 2 people
we tried their seafood fried rice which was sufficient for two adults and their fettuccini chicken pasta.

-arabigos coffee house:
must try for coffee lovers. they‚Äôre known for their cappuccino and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. 
they have their branded coffee beans for sale for 17,000 collone‚Äôs a bag. there is a super market right across and this was super helpful for us to grab snacks, fruits, etc.

-red frog coffee house:
this is a cool little place that does a bit of everything. it‚Äôs across from the el coloso restaurant. they have coffee, meals, souvenirs and cigars etc. they  own the local ice cream joint next door that had excellent ice cream.
their cappuccino was average however loved the service and the experience.",0,955
CostaRica Manuel Antonio Tips,"this is my 1st post in the community. reddit helped me so much to plan this trip and i am paying it forward :)
we just wrapped up a 3 night trip ( march 26-29) in ma and we are off to arenal.

1. the ma national park is a must imo. we used a guide and he was super helpful. they helped us spot so many animals that we wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise. 
learnings: 
- take your swim clothes as the private beach restricted to the park entrants only is beautiful.
- hat, sunscreen, bug spray, your own water bottles ( no plastic and or food allowed) are must have items. note: they do a detailed bag check at the entrance and confiscate food and plastic water bottles etc.

2. manuel antonio beach. overall the beach was beautiful, the ocean was amazing.
- don‚Äôt book surf lessons online or through your hotel. we were quoted some ridiculous prices when i checked prices for a surf lesson for my 8 year old daughter.

- there are various surf schools with little huts on the beach. we used glen castro‚Äôs surf school. he is the only company with a red hut. his service was excellent, price was less than 50% of what was quoted online, and my daughter actually stood up on the surf board and had a memorable experience. i highly recommend him. he also allows his surf boards to be used for the entire day after the lesson.

3. restaurants in this area are very expensive. we tried the bus restaurant  (en todas). it was a chill experience as it‚Äôs on the beach. the food was decent. keep an eye on the items you order as they add up pretty quickly. 

- try the costa linda bar and restaurant for food and drinks at excellent value. locals recommended this place to us. we tried the beef fajitas which were great. beers and cocktails were so much more cheaper than all the other restaurants. they also serve breakfast.
- we had a great experience at el avion. i know some folks didn‚Äôt have the best experience with the food. it has great views, the airplane inside the restaurant provides that unique touch. we tried the mahi mahi dish and the shrimp rice. both were good.
- mila olas restaurant is a little gem in quepos. it‚Äôs about a 10 minute drive from
the ma beach. this place had the best meal we had in ma. they have a great local chef who makes some amazing dishes. we tried the octopus which was next level. the prices were lower than el avion and the food was amazing.

4. when driving to ma beach the dudes wearing wests are on the road acting like traffic cops. they can be pretty aggressive as they walk to the middle of the road with whistles. just be careful. i think it‚Äôs ok to pay them to ensure your car is looked after. we didn‚Äôt park on the beach as our hotel was a so close to the beach.",0,513

Solving Real Estate Problems in Costa Rica,"a distant relative inherited a few lots in costa_rica that they now want to sell. they're empty lots (no buildings), but a squatter has begun to build on at least one of them. there may be issues with water rights. at least one of them needs to have the deed redone because the boundary of the lot is incorrect. they have a broker, but would like things to move along faster. i'm good at taking care of these kinds of things in the united states, but i have never been to costa_rica and my spanish is beginner level.

Most laidback towns,"ever since traveling to costa_rica years ago, it always stuck with me as a place to live and maybe settle. i know taking a trip is far different from day-to-day living.

How is Costa Rica able to protect SO MUCH of its natural land?,"i recently took a vacation with my american family to costa_rica, and the thing that struck me was how wild and natural costa_rica seemed. how can a country as rich as costa_rica resist paving over the whole thing and building lots of malls and amusement parks and towns the way it is the us? is costa_rica just still in the process of building and developing, or have they actually managed to choose consciously to keep the country so natural?

i'm **\*currently writing an essay\*** on this exact question for my college class, and despite a bunch of research i still feel like there's something i'm not getting. so, i thought i might ask for your guys' help. here are the hypotheses i have so far:

‚Ä¢ the 1948 revolution and subsequent demilitarization created a peace-loving self-identity among costa_ricans, and that this was why they were so willing to embrace environmentalism in the 1980s. they just choose to keep so much of the country forested because of their self-identity as environmental stewards.

‚Ä¢ costa_rica's nature is able to stay unspoiled because it can be monetized through ecotourism (although tourism only accounts for 9% of costa_rica's gdp).

‚Ä¢ other countries, as well as multi-national corporations trying to be green, basically pay costa_rica to preserve its nature because of the global benefits of its biodiversity and ability to capture carbon to fight climate change.

‚Ä¢ costa_rica got a slow start after colonization and they are still in the process of replacing a lot of nature with man-made structures (no evidence yet, just a guess).

‚Ä¢ costa_rica's topography and mountains prevent development of a lot of places (not evidence yet, just a guess).

‚Ä¢ i'm just not used to being outside of the us and a lot of places in latin america feel way more natural, jungly, and unspoiled like costa_rica does (conjecture).

i really appreciate any thoughts or corrections that you might have about anything i've said. thanks!",0,336

Advice for 11 days in Costa Rica in September,"coming to costa_rica from canada.  we will arrive late on sept 1 in san_jose and fly home early on sept 13.  so 11 full days to enjoy all cr has to offer.  

i know it's particularly rainy in september.  so my first question is should we avoid it and come back when we can time the weather a bit better?   i assume the answer to that is no, but if it's torrential downpour every day then we might rethink the entire trip. 

if not, we want to split our time between rainforest/mountain interior and beachy/tropical coastline.  we primarily enjoy walking in nature, snorkeling (my partner also dives), beaches, food, and especially wildlife.  i've heard wildlife sanctuaries are in a league of their own in cr, so we probably want to do one or two of those.  we'd probably want to do some cool hikes in the interior as well.  

i'm pretty set on monteverde and la_fortuna for our ""interior"" destinations.  my main question is where to pick for coastal destinations.  i'm between the northwest pacific peninsula (tamarindo, santa maria), or the southern caribbean coast (puerto viejo, manzanillo) - opposite ends of the country.  which is better in terms of weather during early september?  

we plan on renting a car as well.  is that a safe bet?  we really value being in each place for longer than 2 days so i think 3 overnight destinations is our max, but a car would allow us to see the country and make stops in between destinations.  

or if anyone has any recommendations for itineraries i'm not thinking of, it would be greatly appreciated!

If you only had 4 days ‚Äî,"hey yall! if you are willing to read this and help out, i can‚Äôt thank you enough!

so my partner and i are traveling to papagayo in 4 weeks for a wedding. i have very little job flexibility, and, unfortunately, don‚Äôt learn whether my pto is approved until the schedule for that time is published. after months of crossing our fingers, almighty boss man has approved my request, and i‚Äôve got an extra five days to spend in cr!

at this point i have researched my head off and am utterly overwhelmed by how much there is to do and see in cr. partner and i both absolutely love wildlife, particularly birds, but we are going to be 100% worn out from the first half of the trip and very ready to relax.

hopefully this is just our first trip to costa_rica and, next time, we can jam-pack our itinerary with multiple stops. but for this particular stretch of days, i‚Äôm looking for a balance of creature comforts, downtime at the pool/beach, and as much wildlife exposure as possible without a daylong trek into the forest. 

i have found a few resort properties that look great but, before i book, i was wondering if anyone here would be open to sharing any lived-experience suggestions.

a tl;dr re: what i‚Äôm looking for ‚Äî

1. distance from papagayo is the least of my concerns. if there‚Äôs something amazing nearby, the proximity is obviously a bonus, but i am used to driving in high-risk, unfamiliar environments and am undeterred by a road trip. on the other hand, i freak out on tiny planes but will board one if warranted. i care more about the destination than the journey this time around. 

2. nice to luxe-ish resort ($500 usd per night max) that is either beachfront or beach-adjacent. willing to go a little pricier if the beach is true paradise, or it the property is especially serene and/or wellness-oriented

3. plentiful birdwatching opportunities along with some monkeys, iguanas, and, if we‚Äôre lucky, a sloth nearby

1. good surfing and schools (beginner)
2. relaxing/chill 
3. option to meet some women. no professionals. actual women.

I love this beautiful country ‚ù§Ô∏è,"i've been here several times over the last 20 years. the first time i came as a young 20 something, looking for adventure and met my first husband who was working at a beach side bar in playa hermosa near jaco. i stayed with him in jaco for maybe 8 months then we moved to el salvador where he was from originally for another few months before getting married and moving back to the us.
i've since been back many times, even though we are no longer together. 
this trip was just me and my two oldest, my children from that first marriage. they are 15 and 16 now and we came just the three of us for this spring break. it's been such a special trip. their bio dad is not part of their lives (since they were very little) but it's been fun to remember and share some of the good memories i had with him. mostly to see them connect with their latino heritage a bit.

we started our trip in jaco for a few days, did an amazing horseback riding adventure up in the mountains complete with a volcanic mud bath and dip in a jungle river.
next on to beautiful manuel antonio where we did an incredible zipline tour and then a guided tour of the national park where we saw three different kinds of monkeys, two sloths, tucans, bats, lizards. such a beautiful area. i would plan more time there next time!
then on to uvita for our last few days. we walked along the beach to explore the famous whale tale.
we also did a snorkeling trip to ca√±o island. swam with sea turtles and schools of hundreds of beautiful fish. incredible. highly recommend!!
today is our last day in uvita and we're tired, sunburnt and just relaxing. tomorrow we head back to san_jose for our last night in this beautiful country and fly home early monday. 
this itinerary has worked out wonderfully and i would recommend it to anyone looking to experience a few different beach towns.

"It's NOT really ""Pura vida""","i was young and stupid when bought into the marketing scheme of ""pura vida"" and traveled to costa_rica, thinking i would find a  ""paradise"" there. but when i got there i was subjected to almost constant scams by many who first appeared to be friendly, but later turned out to be sophisticated thieves! they basically lured me into a trap and robbed me, almost literally! now, i've learned that costa_rica ecotourism is a massive scam with very effective marketing schemes. there are lots of career criminals operating in costa_rica and many of them are hiding under what seemingly legit. and that kind of deception that got foreign tourists like myself fooled!

What do you wish you had brought with you to Costa Rica?,"this summer i‚Äôll be moving to the central valley for at least two years. 


i‚Äôve been recommended to avoid shipping and just bring extra suitcases (i don‚Äôt own any furniture). i have booked 4 pieces of luggage on my flight. 


aside from clothes, shoes, toiletries and beauty products, what do you rank in the order of best items to bring? 


for example, i love cooking and have a range of (smallish) electrical kitchen appliances. would it be best to sell and buy again in country or bring with me? 


i‚Äôm currently in asia where electronics, housewares and pretty much everything apart from some foreign (western) brands is very affordable. i‚Äôm trying to compile a list of things to buy/bring over but i have to be quite selective as there‚Äôs limited space. 


also, can you order items online, from places like amazon? i am spoilt here with taobao, everything you could ever need at your fingertips within a day or so, usually with free delivery. i know costa_rica will take some adjusting to, but i‚Äôm curious what it is like for online shopping. is it better to go into a store for items? 


i saw some people mention in this subreddit that they have family/friends bring them things over from the us. that is not really an option for me as my family are in europe and most of my friends are here in asia. i hope i get some visitors but i can‚Äôt rely on them to bring me items.

Tips to drive in Costa Rica and some anecdotes,"driving in costa_rica is scary for many newcomers. it is the 4th worst place in the world to drive. so fears aside, what are some tips to understand the life of a driver there?  it is a long post, but i guarantee you that it will be entertaining as not only there are tips but also anecdotes.

costa_rica was a place with farms in 19th century and roads were built around these farms to make horses and carts and from there it evolved to a city, which means that going around the block in many areas takes a long time. farms were built so you see lots of streets getting into the farm that are dead ends.

**why infrastructure is in such poor condition**

in 1948 a dynasty of politicians, 2 parties composed by the elite started to alternate themselves in power. so money started to go to their pockets instead of becoming infrastructure.  so they build roads and then they fix pipes and break it.  or they intentionally plan to build some sections poorly so pot holes appear and there is company revenue in road maintenance reparis. there are many ongloing corruption cases where the elites are using all their power to evade justice in very unethical ways or use media to distract attention from the most important cases. so the final result is decades of poor urban planning, and good roads where you suddenly have a pot hole that will break your car, or unfinished works that could endanger you, or just roads without maintenance for years which had to be fixed by local population.

there is a curious anecdote from more than 20 years ago. the factory of jelly products, el angel was formed by south american expats who did care about making a difference in the community. the road to sarapiqui was in poor condition, so they offered municipality to pay half the price of a road.  they needed that road to bring products out to the city.  the project cranked up and the company started to pour a few milimeters of asphalt instead of the 6 cm thick layer it should have.  the el angel engineer noticed that and demanded to meet the correct specs. the company tried to dismiss him, but then he said that if that was the case, only the municipality would pay half the price, since their donation would not take place.  so they were literally forced to build meeting minimal engineering specs.

this is why costa_rica infrastructure does not look like south korea.  it has been decades of a corrupt oligopoly having control of infrastricture projects. and the toxic corrupt environment has not been fixed in this environment. if you want a stressful life, go to work there at mopt.  politics is still corrupt no matter which party rules.

end result, infrastructure is like driving in the videogame motorstorm apocalypse with utility poles in the street, sinkholes in the street and surprises here and there, and other surprises. did i mention it is the 4th worst place in the world to drive.

with a vehicle fleet growing 7% per year and streets not growing, it became cluttered and traffic jams are terrible.  so do not drive if you do not need to. or enjoy the life of spending hours in a traffic jam. this is especially true if you need to go to the airport to go back home.

try to train yourself using motorstorm apocalypse for playstation. it is a great game to deal with infrastructure susprises like the ones you will find in costa_rica.

for example...

* if you drive going down from tres rios via calle vieja downhill, 3 lanes become 2 and there is a concrete fence of a house at the end and no sign and no bright colors to warn you.  locals know it and avoid it.  they drive fast because they know the road, you do not.
* if you drive from casa matute to the east, you will see some beautiful old trees inside the road in the right side so you better move left to avoid them.
* if you come from san pedro and you go to curridabat, 2 lanes become 1 at a bridge in a curve, and you could crash against a tall concrete sidewalk at night as it is poorly illuminated.
* if you drive from intel to the highway, there is a big sinkhole in the middle of a nice road that would make the nose of the car hit the asphalt if the car bottom is not too high above the road and you drive as fast as the road and speed limit allows.
* speed reductors are so tall sometimes that they may hit the bottom of your car.
* in the expensive neighborhood north of la galera, there is a utility pole in the middle of a clean neat street of a neighborhood of rich people.
* i once met a man who drove in the countryside. there was a narrow concrete bride without fence near a tight dirt curve, so his car did skid, and when he entered the bridge he went to the river, tipped over and his wife died.  he woke up in the hospital after 6 months.

and so many other surprises.  general rule of thumb drive slow, let your visibility determine the speed so you are able to brake if something weird appears.

**a decadent justice system**

since the 1980s the trend of setting criminal offenders free after the arrest made crime to go unpunished.  kids started to learn that stealing has no consequence and dishonesty started to htrive, so if you leave your stiuff unattended in a mall in the city, it is likely that you get your stuff stolen, not by criminals, but ordinary people. it is not that all people are dishonest but enough people are.

in march 2023 us government issued a crime alert for costa_rica

>[eeuu emite alerta de seguridad por aumento de crimen en costa_rica](https://www.crhoy.com/nacionales/eeuu-emite-alerta-de-seguridad-por-aumento-del-crimen-en-costa-rica/)

criminals are sexist and xenophobic, and i am not using political definitions. they literally target women because they think women are weak, and they target foreigners because they think foreigners are rich.  they do not feel that stealing is bad and they believe in using the force and they are entitled and vengeful.

human rights ngos here defend the rights of criminals, but not the rights of tourists and honest locals.

close your windows, do not leave objects inside your car when you are not in it. and learn about where crime is more present. for example, quepos and manuel antonio are known for having surf and tourists, but not too many people will tell you it got filled with crime there too.

**motorcycles everywhere and other demons**

in a cluttered city where traffic jams turned streets into parking lots, people started to buy motorcycles and developed the habit of invading opposite lanes or use lines between lanes as a mototcycle lane.

so you will see bikers passing you in the left and in the right, and if you switch lanes, not only you must watch for other cars, but look motorcycles coming behind.  they will get upset if you ""invade their lane"" as they feel entitled and they may start a fist fight or damage your vehicle if they get upset. many of these bikers do not have license, and the police parking lots are fuilled with motorcycles for this reason, and many of them come from slums or poor neighborhoods where issues are solved with fist fights.

with cars it depends on where you drive. for example, desamaparados canton has a culture of such fist fighting and bullying your way in the street. so if you drive in a place with such subculture, you may expect drivers to have that subculture.  and these people do not stay always inside the canton, so you may find them elsewhere, just a matter of luck.

if you see people doing bad maneuvers that should even look like going against the law, stay calm and stay away, let them pass. you do not want to have a bad day or spend your day in a fight with some uncivilized trash people.

what makes them trash? the subculture of crime polluted people. also a cluttered street and long hours of jams stress people. so more than just evil, what you have is a lack of mental health in the street, to a point where people may get violent in the cities.

so you need full awareness as if you were in a combat zone. look front sides and rear and always know where all vehicles are around you. if they get in your way or they do dangerous things that would earn them a darwin award, stay away from them and let them pass, because you do not want to deal with a crash or insurance paperwork, because that is not what you came to do.

driving is a necessary annoyance to go to point b from point a. so, survive and once you are at point b, enjoy your trip.

if you planned to ride a motorcycle, do not. life is not safe there if you ride one. many drivers are aggressive and will not respect you.

drivers do terrible driving, but most believe they are better drivers than everyone else. you even notice how bad they are when they drive a small car and they have problems to park in a spot designed for a big car.

**driving in slippery roads**

when it starts to rain, even if it is a light rain, water will go under oil drops, so street becomes as slippery as it would with a heavy rain, even if it looks dry. so drive half the speed you would drive normally. this would save your life.

unless you need to drive in rough terrain with a 4x4, rent a sedan because lower cars are more stable.  it is easier to tip over a big car than a sedan. it happens in 2 ways. during collisions, big cars tend to tip over, and in case of evading maneuvers, big cars tip over more easily to the sides.  remember, it is costa_rica, full of curves, not a flat desert in usa.

check the tires because you will need to have the best grip.

if you drive above 40kph, your only option is to hit the brakes if needed.  evading may get you killed, especially in these streets.

**increasing your chances of survival**

there are 3 things that cause 70% of deaths in costa_rican streets:

* **not obeying traffic signs**. not obeting traffic lights or a stop sign cause lots of crashes. so obey traffic signs yourself and use the claxon to warn others as you get close to an intersection and do not drive too fast.
* **invading opposite lane.** head on collisions are one of the main causes of death. going off road will usually be better than a head on collision. when i learned to drive i learned the priorities to evade. cliffs, pedestrians, other vehicles, and pot holes at last. memorize this hierarchy and you will be able to save yourself from a lot of trouble. i use to drive behind a truck that drives at the speed i want to drive, so any invading vehicle would crash against the truck and not me.
* **speeding**.  crashing at 40hoh is like falling from a second floor, you get hurt but you may survive.  crashing at 60kph is like falling from 6 floors, you can only use breaks and keep driving in the same direction because streets are narrow to evade anything. crashing at 90kph is like falling from 13th floor, not survivable. crashing at 120kph is like falling from 22 floors.

there are some miracle cases like the case of a motorcycle driver near the airport who saw a traffick light going yellow and he accelerated. but red reached him and a car came out, so he crashed at 120kph and he spent years learning to walk.

if you do not engage in any of these 3 behaviors and you protect yourself against those who do, then you increase your survival chances.

**health insurance**

there is a government institution called ccss that provides public healthcare. for foreigners who plan to stay longer, getting a ""seguro voluntario"" (voluntary insurance) is a good option. basically you declare yourself as a freelancer with an estimated income, which is used to calculate the monthly fee.

may be for things like a surgery or chronic or rare disease it may take forever, but for most common health problems it is a great option. what common problems? you got diarrhea because you ate a bad food, you had an accident at home and got hurt, etc.

it will save lots of money. you do not need to worry about bills and most common medicines are covered.

the only catch is that seguro voluntario is voluntary to join, but to get out you need to prove them that you got hired by a company in costa_rica, which will pay your insurance from that point on.  still, even if you need to pay it forever, it is always a great option to have a very affordable healthcare service. this monthly fee is the only price to use the service, so you do not care about money when you are sick.

this is especially useful if you send your kid to take college in costa_rica using public school system that is free. no debt. just tell your kid to not consume substances because i mentioned that criminals are xenophobic, so your kid will need to stay away from these troublemakers that will try to take advantage of foreigners. and ccss healthcare is a great way to protect your kid. so free college and cheap healthcare will save your kid from debt and health problems.  check how to make college in costa_rica valid in your country.

i hope you stay healthy, but if you have issues, ccss insurance is a nice option for non complex health issues.  if you plan to live in costa_rica, i really advise to get health from ccss at least as a backup plan, and if you want to use private medicine, that is up to you.

**epilogue**

i have tried to be honest about costa_rica. i could have sugar coated itand appeal to the trope of costa_rica pura vida and essential costa_rica, but i preferred to tell you how things are.   most of people in all nations are usually good people, but there are situations that may not be that nice.

i feel that between the deterioration of making a living conditions, traffic jams, protection towards criminals, and lack of mental health, costa_rica is getting less pura vida for locals.  and that impacts tourists too.

still costa_rica is not the worst place in the world. it has supervised banks where balances are monitored more transparently than in other developed countries, so regulators know exactly what happen with banks and are able to tackle financial crisis more effectively.  everything is close, so you do not have to drive miles to buy something.  and food is fresh. it is not like going to a big country and eat a sandwich with vegetables that remained one week in a fridge after a long trip in a truck.  so it also is harder to have empty shelves, and if they eventually, buying elsewhere is easy as distances are not too long.

living in ""condominio"" (groups of apartment buildings or houses with or without parking and other amenities and a fence around) is better as they have security guard. houses do not.

having a car is a must unless there is a good bus service near you to connect you to places of interest.  that is very rare to find. so a car is needed.  it is better to buy a ""seminuevo"" car from car agency (new cars are not worth it) and save money to avoid debt.  used cars are a hassle in costa_rica as they try to sell you garbage, and via internet you may get scammed in costa_rica. and finding a reliable mechanic is like finding a honest politician.  so consider finding a reliable mechanic as part of the car purchase.

obviously you will need a parking lot, so consider that when renting a place.  learn with locals which are places where criminals live (almost everyone knows that), and find a place away from these places.

and make sure you have the best tires with the best grip. in costa_rican street grip of good tires is one of the best cost effective tools to protect yourself from an accident.

the best way to live is to be a contrarian. instead of going where everyone goes, do the opposite, like taking a trip during low season. that way a hotel and swimming pool and restaurant will be almost just for you. and as you are not with the crowd, you will also not be in the traffic jam with other people. and by doing so you are helping a business to survive as you are a customer that helps them to have some revenue in low season.  so plan trips in non holidays.

if you want to get the best prices for groceries, costa_rica government has an app [here](https://www.mimejorcompracr.go.cr/).  you indicate a location and product and it will tell you which are the best places to buy.  that will make your life more affordable now that usd is going down.",0,2950

zip line, jet ski, horse back riding on the beach, see the wild life. looking for great food places & bars. also what are great places to do all these things we were looking to stay more central of costa_rica like manuel antonio. we are also looking to travel to many places to stay a few nights in different areas of costa_rica. what would be the smartest way to travel, should we rent a car? we‚Äôve decided to airbnb.",0,145
CR in June: looking for help with itinerary and other things,"hello! i've wanted to visit costa_rica for a long time and now i'm finally going in june. i'll be there for almost three weeks and i don't know much yet, so i hope you can  help me plan my trip.

the \[very loose\]  plan so far is to rent a car and travel to some different spots for the first week or two, then do workaway (working in exchange for food and accommodation) somewhere nice.

in general, i don't want to spend a ton of money on accommodation and food, and i'd prefer to avoid places that are too overcrowded by tourists. but i'm sure there are some absolute must-sees and must-dos; just finding a good balance between that and a more unique/authentic experience would be cool.

some questions:

1. places to visit?
2. car/terrain: i've heard roads in cr can be pretty unwelcoming, so what kind of car do you recommend that i rent? 4x4 drive? specific rental companies you recommend?
3. how do i know where i'm allowed to camp in cr?
4. any options for meeting natives living in more traditional ways, maybe staying with them for a few days?
5. considering what i've written above, for how long would you recommend i travel around before settling down to do workaway?
6. what are some traditional costa_rican dishes?
7. spanish phrases/words specific to costa_rica?
8. my spanish has gotten rusty so i think it could help to start watching some movies in spanish, and they might as well be from costa_rica. any good movies to recommend?
9. internet/data sim card for my phone?",0,270

We are about to lose a very important element of our country's gastronomy and culture.,"this is what's at stake if the big cooperative dos pinos and sigma have their way and manage to take away the designation of origin for queso turrialba in costa_rica.

not only would we ticos lose a part of our identity and tradition, but the small producers would find it even harder to connect with the general consumer and show the quality of their products. (if you didn't know about queso turrialba's designation of origin, you can read more about it [here](http://bit.ly/40pemoa) )


even though dos pinos and sigma have already tried twice to get rid of this distinction and lost both times, they continue to use their vast economic resources to make it happen. they are currently on their third try. (you can read more about the lawsuit  [here](https://bit.ly/3jbrd34) )

this lawsuit is underway, and after an audience scheduled for this week, where small producers are presenting their case, there are only 20 days before a veredict is reached.
so, what can be done to protect our culture and help the small producers?


learn more about these big corporations and their efforts to strip costa_rica out of the designation of origin for queso turrialba.

share this information with your friends, family and contacts on social media.

let's go viral with this information to create pressure on dos pinos and sigma. let's show them that the consumers reject their obscene attempts to strip our country of it's identity just for profit and bulldoze the small producers out of the economic stage.

it's critical that we share this information now and generate as much noise as possible, to create awareness.

if we all fight together, we can help the small producers from being striped down of what little advantage they have to compete against these giants like dos pinos and sigma.
let's share this and continue to enjoy the real queso turrialba and help keep our traditions for future costarrican generations. 

let us fight to protect costarrican culture and costarrican gastronomy!

please share this message and help us safeguard our identity as a country.",0,345

What to ask when renting a house,"[edited to add since i buried the lede: i have found a lot of housing prospects, just don‚Äôt want to get screwed in the process of signing a lease, and hoping to know what areas i should pay special attention to when discussing a lease, negotiating terms, and viewing properties. especially if there is any contract language or law peculiar to costa_rica.] 

i‚Äôm searching for rental housing in costa_rica over the next month or two. i‚Äôve tried with a couple realtors and they seem to keep pressuring me above my stated budget (trying to keep it below 400,000 crc/month and looking at very modest places not in gated wealthy expat compounds, and i‚Äôve found a number of options between facebook and encuentra24 thanks to the kind folks in this subreddit). 

since it seems like i may not be able to go through an agency‚Äîwhat sort of things will i need to know as a first time renter in costa_rica? are there things i should know to ask?

is there a standard rental term expectation (e.g., 1 year as in the us?) or are the owners more flexible? more rigid? i also have pets‚Äîis it normal to have a pet deposit as it is in the us?

are there any especially worrisome things i should look out for?

Trip to Costa Rica summary: (Also thanks to the best!),"first off, wanna start off by saying, costa_rica is a beautiful country and it has an amazing story on how it‚Äôs came over the years.

- passing by a few signs that had property for sale, it sort of had me tempted haha. however, after listening to some of the awesome staff at hacienda and some vendors i met on the way, figured it wasn‚Äôt the most respectful thing to do.

- i will be visiting again, but i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be moving in anytime soon after seeing the devastation negligent foreign investments have caused. i wish this would be more known to people coming into your country, it‚Äôs a great place for us travelers and more people need to see it! again, thanks so much costa_rica!

2 weeks in November/December,"my family (wife and 3 year old) and i have booked a 2 week trip to costa_rica, our first visit! we'll be there nov. 20th to dec. 6th.

we have a rough idea of what we'd like to do, but given that we've never been i wanted to double check with the experts that what we'd like to do is realistic, both in general, and with a 3 year old in tow.

our general itinerary is to fly into san jos√© and spend the first week of our trip in the monteverde area. our family loves to hike and loves wildlife. i'm a semi-professional photographer so i'm especially excited about this area. 

our second week we're  planning on gong to the beach and the caribbean coast seems very appealing, given its more low-key nature than most places on the pacific. access to calm  beaches and short jungle walks is what we're after. we don't like crowds and we're not visiting for the surf.

my only concern about the above itinerary is that monteverde and the caribbean coast being in opposite directions of san jos√©, so there will be a lot of back tracking, but i do feel that we have the time. 

a few questions: 
1) is public transportation to and from those areas a good and reliable option? 

2) is there anywhere between cahuita and monteverde that would be a nice stop to break up a long travel day?

3) is there a pacific beach area that would offer similar low-key vibes that the caribbean offers?

 the general idea is to try and make local products more accesible and at the same time, shine the spotlight a little brighter on the producers, so that the consumer can get to know the people making the stuff they want to buy, learn about their effort and hopefully, help them keep their traditions so that their legacy can live on. this will eventually help shift the scales in favour of the original producers, and help them get the bigger piece of the pie, as they should. 

so if you have a little time to check it out, i encourage you to do so. 
the project is just getting off the ground, so the lineup of products is modest in quantity, but rich and bountiful in quality. i hope you get to experience that for yourselfs. at the moment, delivery is available for folks in the great metropolitan area only, but they plan to expand the area of service eventually. 

have a great day!",0,245
Costa rica: dengue and zika,"hi everyone,

traveling to costa_rica end of march and just found out i am pregnant. i am super worried about the zika and dengue risk and unable to find any current stats & affected areas. it seems like zika is pretty uncommon but dengue is more dominant? 

any insight would be much appreciated as we are thinking of canceling the trip in case it is unsafe. which areas should we avoid (we planned on staying on pacific side only with la_fortuna/monteverde)? i would be wearing strong repellent but still don‚Äôt want to be constantly freaking out.

thanks for any insights!",0,102
Beware of investments in CR that seem too good to be true,"this a cautionary tale for people to not invest abroad until they have seen things with their own eyes, have the guidance of a local lawyer and live in the area for a while, to avoid such bitter surprises.

Thank you for an incredible 3 weeks! Trip report + photos,"last month, i visited cr for the first time and had an incredible time. thank you to the ticos and ticas i met that helped us out along our journey, never once did i feel like i was in danger or someone was trying to scam us. cr is such a beautiful country with a way of life the rest of the world can learn from. although, it's pretty easy to live pura vida when you live by some of the nicest beaches in the world. 

in week 1, i stayed in the remote mountain town of santa maria de dota, they just so happened to have their annual fair on the day we arrived so it was a great experience of authentic costa_rican food,  music and culture. it's a nice town for great coffee and good restaurants, but a bit sleepy with little to no nightlife. we probably should've done a couple days instead of a whole week- but it was interesting to be immersed in a virtually tourist-free area. 

week 2, we went to uvita, a beautiful small beach town with a national park that has a beach with two shores! definitely pretty touristy and not cheap, but some local-owned options are around. our whale tour with dolphin tours was awesome- fernando knew so much and was a passionate speaker, we almost didn't go because of the price but i guarantee it's worth every penny. playa uvita was my favourite beach and the most serene part of my trip, golden hour here was jaw-dropping. 

week 3, i stayed at selina in manuel antonio and had such a fun time. the beaches in the national park are great, and the sunsets were some of the best i've ever seen. i liked the sodas to choose from just outside the national park, good authentic costa_rican food for a decent price. staying at the selina was great as i was working some days so i used their co-working office on the rooftop. 

i had 3 very different experiences over 3 weeks, and still have so much to see in the country, i will 100% be coming back for another trip to see the north and caribbean side. but all in all, i'm happy with how the trip played out, i learned spanish, i had great food, met so many people from all different walks of life and took some of the best pictures i've ever taken. check out some of the highlights:

Rentista law change?,"hi everyone! 

i'm in the process of renewing my temporary rentista residency, and two years ago i had put the required $60,000 usd into a cd at my local banco nacional and completed the process without any issues. this year, the tellers at the bank said that they were unable to do the same thing as before because of a change in the laws, and the representative i'm speaking to said that i would have to 1. speak with a cpa who will certify that i have an income in the us, then 2. open a trust with the bank (and pay 1.5k in bank fees) before i can get the certification to renew the card.

i've tried looking up any recent changes in immigration requirements, but i only found the tax exemptions that passed in late february. has anyone else been through this recently, and does it sound accurate as to how the process should be? this seems kind of convoluted and much more complicated than before.

Rental home broken into in Costa Rica,"traveling in costa_rica the past two weeks. met up with my group of friends on monday and have been in the house we rented near uvita all well. last night while away, our home and three separately attached bedrooms were broken into and valuables stolen. money, a few passports, headphones were taken. obviously it was not smart to leave any money/passports home and that is recognized by those in the group whose things were taken. (just stating that because that‚Äôs clearly the first mistake up on our parts) 

we are renting through a property company. they sent maintenance to fix the broken doors which took about five minutes. they said they would review security footage. the alarm did not go off. they said this has never happened at this property. 

the rental company is supposed to come to the house in the next few hours to discuss and advise.  

my friends whose passport were stolen are going to make a police report for the embassy. 

what other steps can we do in this situation? is there any other information to ask from the rental company? clearly traveling comes with this risk and theft is common in cr especially this situation but want to be as proactive as i can. friends in my group are concerned about safety and leaving the house at all for the remainder of the trip. looking for any advice on how to navigate this situation and still enjoy the remainder of this trip.

Volunteering Summer 2023,"hi there,

i am a 18 year old college student from the u.s. and i am hoping to do some conservation volunteer work for around five weeks this summer. i am trying to avoid third-party ""volunteer"" organizations where i have to pay a lot of money. i am wondering if opportunities where i work in exchange for free room and board exist, or if i should expect to pay some amount per week. 

i am particularly interested in marine life (turtles, dolphins, etc.) and would love to live on a beach or near a beach town. i am looking for recommendations for real conservation organizations where i can find volunteers my age. i am excited to work outside and make friends and am ok with working long days. i also am proficient (not fluent but want to be!) in spanish.

a) is it true that costa_ricans don't use ""tu"" to address ""you"" and would rather use ""usted"" or ""vos""? if so, then what's the difference between usted and vos?

"10 Day Trip (Puerto Viejo, La Fortuna, Tamarindo)","hi everyone - apologies for the lengthy post, i tend to ramble. my boyfriend, his friend and i will be visiting costa_rica mid march for 10 days.  additional background: i visited cr in 2018 and did a very quick (but amazing and action packed) trip to la_fortuna for 2 nights and then flew sansa and did 3 nights in manuel antonio.  my boyfriend visited in 2017 and had a quick stay in puerto viejo for 4 days. this trip i‚Äôm open to anything but would like to visit friends in tamarindo if possible and boyfriend wants to return to puerto viejo for sure. our friend who is joining doesn‚Äôt have any preference.  does my proposed itinerary seem too hectic? open to all/any suggestions, thank you! 

we arrive kind of late (9pm) in san_jose so we figured we‚Äôd stay the night there on day of arrival 3/7. then next morning we head to puerto viejo for 3 nights (don‚Äôt have transportation worked out yet) (3/8-3/11). we have a rental airbnb in playa cocles which comes with bikes so not sure if we should even bother renting a car? after checkout on 3/11 we wanted to do rafting at pacuare river and they will pick us up in puerto viejo and we have the option to be dropped off either in san_jose or la_fortuna.  i was thinking la_fortuna. i assume after rafting that the drop off would be later in the evening. so i‚Äôm thinking to stay another day/night in la_fortuna 3/11-3/13. now from la_fortuna leaving 3/13 morning, would it be trying to do too much to rent a car and drive to tamarindo, possibly around the nicoya peninsula, montezuma, and then ferry back to puntarenas and return to san_jose? 

we fly home 12:30am on 3/18 so we have to be back in san_jose airport later 3/17 evening. we basically have 5 days to go from la_fortuna to tamarindo (my friends own the grateful hotel) then either stay 1-2 nights there and continue on. maybe one night in nosara/samara and then a night in montezuma. then take our time getting back to san_jose from montezuma?  too much driving? i‚Äôm open to suggestions!",0,372

so, what is the easiest way to get from quepos to liberia?  i don't see any direct flights through sansa, and not sure we want to fly into sjo and change planes to lir.  but it also looks like a pretty long and expensive drive if we were to get a shuttle the entire way.  i also thought of maybe splitting it up and getting a shuttle to monteverde or somewhere along the way, and then get a shuttle from there to lib the next day.  any suggestions?  or, are we better off just staying further north like we had originally intended?",0,219

Costa Rica itinerary,"hi solo female, first time solo outside us

here's my tentative itinerary, 8 days, early feb (soon), not sure whether to rent a care or schedule shared transfers.  speak some spanish, full complex sentences and conversations would be a struggle.

i'm looking for unique experiences (unique from what i might get hiking or exploring most other places in the world). avid hiker.
mud baths, bioluminescent beaches, canyoning, night nature walk, caves, volcanoes, snorkeling, kayaking interest me. i love coffee and dark chocolate.

flying in and out of sjo, looked at liberia but this is a last minute trip so way too expensive and long flights. 

day 1 sjo, late night arrival. 
day 2 la_fortuna. maybe stop along the way
day 3 la_fortuna
day 3 la_fortuna to monteverde with stop in rio celeste (if i rent a car)   ?
day 4 monteverde 
day 5 monte verde to nicola (caves?) or other stop
day 6 nicola to montezuma 
day 7 montezuma or santa teresa, maybe tortuga island and a bioluminescence kayak tour
day 8 montezuma (or somewhere closer to ferry) to sjo, 1:37 pm flight

possible? enjoyable? alternative locations? should i cut out a stop? advice welcome, there are so many awesome places to choose from. this is a trip i'm taking in between quitting and old job and starting a new one so looking to start of with adventure and end with peaceful experiences.

Osa peninsula with 4.5 year old? (cross-posted to r/costaricatravel),"(i posted this to r/costaricatravel as well, not sure what the best place is for advice)

tldr: is it stupid to go to the osa peninsula with a 4.5 year old who can ""only"" hike 3-4 miles? if so, where should we go instead? if not, what should we do in the osa and is it a good idea to stay by the beach?

looking for advice and suggestions from people who know the osa peninsula. we are just starting to plan our trip for next february, when our son will be 4.5 years old. we are most interested in seeing wildlife, and our secondary interest is beach time. i've read amazing things about corcovado np, but it seems like the hikes are very intense and the journey just to enter the park can be long. my kid is adventurous and has boundless energy, but he'll be under 5 years and and it just doesn't seem like going into the park would be the best plan for our family (please let me know if i'm wrong here!).

if we are looking at the osa peninsula area, what would be our best bet for experiencing wildlife and the rainforest without going into corcovado? is it even worth it to go to the area and not go into the park? i know it is a long journey from sj, so we're planning to spend at least 4 days in the area. we're looking at some places that are on the beach, so we could do wildlife hikes and beach time. any particular areas or lodging that you'd recommend? i had been looking into amazonita ecolodge near dos brazos as a mid-range solution, or casa bambu (maybe too expensive) in matapalo.

i have read a lot about manuel antonio and i'm sure it would be more accessible and ""kid-friendly"", but it also seems like a crowded tourist magnet. if we're spending the airfare and the vacation time, we'd like to go somewhere that we can really experience the local vibe and wildlife for multiple days. we're ok with our trip being adventurous and our accommodations being sparse, as long as we are safe and can experience wildlife and make good family memories together.

Interested in visiting but don't know where to start,"i know people usually prepare an itinerary to critique but i've had a really shitty time in life lately and i'm looking for guidance as a relatively blank slate if anyone is feeling generous with their knowledge. 

i'm looking to spend 10-11 days in costa_rica maybe in march. spectacular nature scenes, hiking, hot springs, an ayahuasca retreat, and surfing lessons are all things that interest me. i don't need to spend time at any location just to say i've been there (so if you say skip san_jose, i will skip it). my priorities are relishing unique sights, good quality and not overpriced food, and enjoying tropical activities. 

suggestions on accommodations would be great. i'm very open to hostels as long as they're safe. i won't be driving so any tips about buses and other public transport would also be helpful. 

not sure about which airport to fly into and depart from (seen a lot saying liberia) and recs on how long to stay in specific areas would be nice. i'm someone who is not in a rush to leave a town or city after a photo op if it can be enjoyed for another day or 2 (or even longer). i prefer to take in the scene but still have options for activities (including nightlife) especially since i don't get to travel much.

headed to cr on february 22. my flight gets in at 1pm. i‚Äôm looking for opinions/insight on best plan to get to la_fortuna. i have read often not to drive at night especially the route from sjo to lf but i really would prefer to get to lf on the 22 since i will only be there for the 23,24 (headed to ma on the 25). i don‚Äôt particularly want to spend that first night in sjo if not necessary. 

so my question is if it‚Äôs possible to land, go through customs, pick up rental car (vamos) and make it to lf by sunset (which is at 6pm). i know the drive can be around 3 hours. is this possible? or will getting through customs take too long and i will be stuck finishing my drive in darkness?

Terrorised solo female travel,"hello everyone !
few months ago i decided to travel alone in costa_rica for 5 days. i am supposed to visit the tortuguero park and cahuita park.

now than the flight date is approaching i am terrorised.

- can i wear shorts (or should i wear long pants)?
- i would like to take shuttle bus but i am afraid to be alone with a driver
- i would like to book some tours but i am afraid to be alone with a male guide
- i want to visit the park but i am afraid of meeting someone in the forest (like a solo man or group of men)

Sexual assault at Hacienda Guachipelin,"update: the guy was fired. 

i got a formal letter from guachipelin confirming it. native's way, the tour operator that took me and the other 2 women there got involved and pressed for a resolution. i'm pleased. of course this should have never happened but there is almost no accountability for this type of thing. i'm so thankful for this community's support. thank you all for your comments, they've really buoyed me in this experience. <3

----------------------------

heads up to the community about this place. i visited yesterday with a native‚Äôs way tour. we did the adventure combo at guachipelin which includes zip line course. 

part of the zip line course is a tarzan swing where you swing and are caught on the other side. their staff member, some teenage looking kid, caught me by the boobs - like, cupping my breasts with his hands. at first i thought maybe it was an accident but he literally had his hands on me, i was already on the ground and stable, and he‚Äôs just holding my boobs. 

next, same kid is supposed to hook you up to the next zip line. this guy gets me all set up and connected, and now his hand is in between my legs. i literally pushed his hand off me. 

just off the course i went to the bus where two other women in my group said the same thing happened to them by the same guy. 

i spoke with the manager and then with their general manager. it was a strange convo and i don‚Äôt know what is going or if they‚Äôve actually gotten rid of this guy. their manager was very apologetic and said they were going to do an investigation and talk to hr, but i‚Äôm the same breath she‚Äôs telling me this might have been unintentional and just an unfortunate catch position. let me be really clear that women know when it‚Äôs unintentional/accidental and when they are being touched inappropriately by someone who has the right cover to deny it. she also said that she asked our tour lead and other tours and no one else said anything. i hate that i need to explain to another woman that women almost always don‚Äôt come forward with this stuff. three women on one bus don‚Äôt require extensive investigations and the secret shopper program she told me about to validate that you have a problem. 

she promised me an update on the hr meeting that i haven‚Äôt yet received. i would strongly warn others to stay away from there until they make it eminently clear how they‚Äôve handled this situation.",0,437

My neighbour's dog just attacked my dog. What do I do?,"hey everyone,

i was looking for some advice.  today, my dog was attacked by the neighbour's dog when my girlfriend was on a run with my dog. their gate was left open, and they have a clearly aggressive dog.

the dog went to bite both my girlfriend (who was trying to stop it) and my dog.  luckily nobody was hurt, and my dog has a few bites and scratches. this could have been \*a lot\* worse. it took my neighbours a long time to come out and help stop their dog from attacking mine. my girlfriend was not able to stop their dog by herself.

their excuse was, ""we don't know how to gate got open"", but i don't really care what their excuse is. this was neglect, and it could have caused serious harm.

i'm worried that this could happen again. what should i do to protect my girlfriend and dog in the future? should i ring the police despite no serious harm coming to anyone? i don't want my concerns to be dismissed because the situation didn't turn out worse than it did.

i am an expat from the uk and my girlfriend is a tica. any help would be greatly appreciated.

**edit:**

i was originally a little angry when writing this post, as it was right after the incident. i've calmed down considerably. my dog went to the vet, and although not the prettiest to look at, i've decided to attach an image of the outcome.

[https://imgur.com/a/zdeonyl](https://imgur.com/a/zdeonyl)

we spoke to our neighbour, and she was extremely upset about what her dog had done and was in disbelief at her dog's behaviour. we only requested they pay for the vet bill, which they did without hesitation. we will not pursue anything further unless it happens again.

these are now fine to bring and use as they classify as food supplements, except full spectrum ones which have 0.3 thc, stick to broad spectrum or lower. 

#thc products

not allowed, don't risk it, don't ask it. only therapeutic use is approved but not implemented yet, so to try, you'll need a prescription to be safe to bring your own which will be reviewed by staff at the airport that could include a medic, **but even that is not for sure yet**, the law on this is not even 6 months old and they haven't finished it. the prescription part is only general common sense based on current status and should not be taken as official. it is safer to not bring any of this substance. 

#marijuana plant for smoking

not allowed to bring or sell, locally, self growing the plant for personal use is not illegal, but sharing with others or selling it is, so as a tourist there is no legal way to obtain marijuana to smoke.

**what to do if i really really need it?**

 if you will have withdrawals from not consuming we recommend you visit at a later time, since currently there is no way to advise you on obtaining this substance legally, you can still easily find it illegally (easier than you think) but we don't recommend that and ask you not to.

*we i'll update the community when the law changes, for now any posts or comments that seem to overlook this post will be removed.

Rincon de la Vieja vs Arenal,"visiting the country flying into liberia end of january. i had a plan of going liberia to tenorio to la_fortuna/arenal to monteverde back to liberia in about 5 days.

now i‚Äôm considering cutting out the tenorio/lf/arenal leg and going right to monteverde before coming back up to liberia and then heading to rincon de la vieja.

the main things i want to do are hike through rainforest, observe some wildlife, get up close to volcanic activity, zip line and swim. with this criteria, can someone tell me if rincon is a suitable replacement for tenorio/lf/arenal? i have a rental car, so the purpose of the switch is to cut down on driving and simplify the trip.

Selling a property in Costa Rica,"hello! good morning! 

i hope you are having a great day. this is a bit of a too formal post, haha. first time here but let's get down to businesses. it is halfway a rant and halfway a genuine question. i know most of the redditors here are expats and foreigners. i do not mind at all. and i apologize beforehand if someone feels offended. 

&#x200b;

i really hope i am not disrespecting anyone. :)

i am not aiming it to someone directly, neither. 

and i am being very honest and straight forward about it. how the hell are you such scoundrels to come down here in cr, buy a huge property for 250k (which is not pretty much money), and build a goddamn house worth $1.5 / $2 million dollars? and why am i so out of my mind? because my neighbor has that house and i couldn't care any less. but it is not the thing. a horde of foreigners (mostly, americans and canadians landed here. nearby dominical and uvita) came many years ago, and they are still comming. they buy people's properties at a very low price and build freaking mansions. bloody tuesday!! i do not think it is any fair. like, what the hell is going on? do we look like indigenous and illiterate people? do we look stupid or something? like, i do not know... it is annoying to me. and the funniest and mindblowing part is that these people who sell their properties wasted the money and ended up doing gardening for the new owners. for real, i have seen it. they basically sold everything to become employees. that is very unfortunate. most of them have no education, they are merchants and farmers with zero to none knowledge about money, i feel like you are giving us mirrors and we are giving you our gold. like in the ancient times with the colonizers. 

&#x200b;

anyway, probably in 2017 a guy came around trying to buy the property of a relative, 13 hectares (130.000 squared meters). for just $1.5 millions of dollars. we did not accept the deal cause we know what they are capable of doing. so, now, the price is at least $5 millions of dollars. you could do anything you want here. completely private, no neighbors nearby, all the property is a huge mountain, no construction, own spring of water, river around the property, and two creeks, also it has a nice lookout to la isla del ca√±o - and many more things. and just 4km to the main highway. all the services are close, anything you need. the beach is just 20 minutes away. you got the best of both worlds, mountain and beach. so, i wonder how feasible is to find someone willing to pay that amount of money, if you know how to find a person interested or how to sell properties i'd be more than glad if i could know more.

thanks, have a great day :)",0,500

Best city for remote work and dating in Costa Rica?,"i am thinking of escaping the cold in the us and working remotely from costa_rica for january and february.  i have a few reasons for the trip:

* tons of nature to explore!
* spanish - i tried learning spanish in college, but didn‚Äôt get very far.  i‚Äôve been wanting to get back into it for years, so i‚Äôm going to try forcing myself to learn.
* dating - i am 32, male, recently single, and live in a male-dominated tech city in the us. although i‚Äôm fairly happy with the dating scene here, i‚Äôm curious to see what dating is like outside of the us. also, i find foreigners attractive, so i feel like i would find a larger portion of women attractive if i get out of the us.

so i‚Äôm looking for a town or city that has:

* reliable internet for working remotely
* fun places to explore in the afternoon and evening. parks or beaches and a decent selection of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs
* a decent-sized dating scene. preferably a town with dating apps and/or more than just one bar with a handful of people.

i‚Äôve done an extensive amount of research, but i‚Äôm still torn. at the moment, i‚Äôm considering three cities: san_jose, jaco beach, and tamarindo. now, i have some questions.

san_jose - the city looks great in terms of bars and restaurants, and the dating scene. but i‚Äôm concerned about parks.  is san_jose a pretty city?  are there nice parks?  is it safe to walk around and explore in the afternoon and night?  i will have a rental car and can explore outside the city on weekends, but it would be nice to get outside on weekdays. on a side note, i would still love suggestions for bars and restaurants, and especially nightclubs, because all of the ones i found on google maps are either brothels/strip clubs or closed during covid.

jaco beach - this is probably my top pick. it seems pretty ideal as far as internet, restaurants/bars/clubs, and the beach. my concern is about the dating scene.  i haven‚Äôt been there yet, so i‚Äôd appreciate some forgiveness, but the way others have talked about it, it sounds like there are a lot of prostitutes.  are there also regular women that would want to go on dates, or would all of my online matches and girls i meet at bars be prostitutes? is there a way to tell them apart, like tattoos or anything?   ftr i don't have an issue with their profession and it‚Äôs not a question of money to me. from the sound of it, most of these girls are looking for less than the cost of a normal date in the us. i just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs my scene / what i‚Äôm looking for. besides, a big reason for the dates is to meet people to explore on weekends and help me with my spanish.

tamarindo - it seems like a more mellow version of jaco beach. like, maybe there‚Äôd be less prostitution, but i‚Äôd be worried about everything else: unreliable internet, not enough bars/restaurants/clubs, and a small dating pool. any thoughts?

thanks for the help! i think any of these cities would be in my budget, so i‚Äôd prefer not to factor cost into the equation.  if i can‚Äôt decide, i might try to explore all three for my first week before booking a property for the remaining month or two.",0,579
"Met a girl from Costa Rica online who's having problems with abusive parents, what to do?","so there's this girl i met online just a couple weeks ago that is 17 and is having troubles to get into college, since it's expensive and she needs to get a scholarship. for that reason her mother wants to send her to live with her father since she won't be studying for a year, but she said her father is really abusive to her. and it'd be that or a shelter, where she said also happens a lot of abuse to girls. i don't know much about costa_rica, i recommended that she should find a job to help her mother meanwhile, but she says that's very difficult as well since some places won't accept adolescents.

Ver parejas un poco m√°s j√≥venes que yo mientras estoy solo me hace sentir tristeza,"la verdad como ya he dicho en otras publicaciones nunca he tenido novia, tampoco he tenido nunca mi primer beso, ni siquiera un besito r√°pido y corto o como lo llaman besito de ""piquito"", ni siquiera un besito en la mejilla o un abrazo o cualquier tipo de afecto femenino de una chica que no sea una familiar, pero bueno volviendo al grano, aveces cuando voy por la calle caminando por el parque o en el centro comercial y veo parejas me siento inc√≥modo y triste porque ver parejas tomadas de la mano o besandose en frente de mi es algo inc√≥modo y triste porque yo nunca he tenido novia, adem√°s aveces pienso que lo hacen a prop√≥sito para hacerme sentir triste o recordarme lo solitario que soy, recuerdo que hace poco iba caminando cuando una pareja joven estaba en frente de mi y se quedaron ah√≠ parados y me vieron y comenzaron a besarse, pase a su lado y tuve que fingir que estaba viendo a otro lado. tambi√©n un d√≠a v√≠ una pareja de unos 13 o 14, besandose y me di√≥ mucha tristeza, porque yo a esa edad nunca tuve oportunidad de tener novia ni siquiera mi primer beso, me da mucha  tristeza ver parejas mientras yo estoy solo.",0,212

Qanon Conspiracy Theories Impact World Wide - Costa Rican Anti Vaxxers & Politics,"the more i think about it and investigate the reasons behind qanon and how it continues to impact us politics today. the more i understand how misinformation and social media is one of the most powerful tools in the world.

when you delve in local facebook groups & new posts for vaccine news (costa_rican news) you can read & feel an increasing rhetoric amongst a significant minority in the country that simply have the most terrible reasons no to get vaccinated.

the steps the government is taking against requiring vaccination proof for tourists will in the end be a double sided blade, in the meanwhile we see the third covid 19 wave hitting hard on countries like:

1. uk
2. br
3. at
4. us

its baffling to me to read and watch local costa_ricans supporting such theories and outrageous claims.

much of campaign that paints costa_rica (rich coast) as a paradise with slogans like ""pura vida"" has now been shattered by the growing violence that resembles the kind seen in mexico and colombia. the government of cr is either too lazy, too incompetent, too corrupt, or all of the above!

"He perdido la esperanza de tener una novia y cumplir mis sue√±os y deseos, soy un perdedor.","hola, aqu√≠ otra vez yo el inc√≥gnito solitario

la verdad se que √∫ltimamente he estado publicando mucho contenido en d√≥nde menciono que nunca he tenido novia ni primer beso y que no tengo amigos y soy un fracaso, pero quiero desahogarme, la verdad no me da confianza de desahogarme con una persona as√≠ en la vida real porque probablemente me insulten o termine destruyendo la poca dignidad que me queda, es por eso que me desahogo aqu√≠ en reddit expresando la tristeza y gran desepcion que siento casi todos los d√≠as.

bien, la verdad como dice el t√≠tulo de la publicaci√≥n he perdido casi toda la esperanza de tener una novia y cumplir con mis deseos y mis sue√±os, la verdad uno de mis sue√±os y deseos que tengo es el de tener una novia y a largo plazo mi sue√±o a cumplir con ella es tener hijos, los cuales tengo planeado llamarlos daniel y dylan o nicol√°s y si son ni√±as las planeo llamar laura y mariana, aunque me gustaria que si tuviera novia ella eligiera un nombre para uno de nuestros hijos y cada uno le ponga un nombre a un beb√© y ser√≠a muy lindo formar una familia. tambi√©n otro de mis deseos a largo plazo son trabajar en algo que me guste como por ejemplo algo relacionado con computaci√≥n, la verdad pr√°cticamente tengo mi vida planeada, quisiera tener una novia y despu√©s conseguir ese trabajo y una vez que est√© trabajando formar una familia para as√≠ tener la posibilidad de mantener a mi familia. pero lamentablemente creo que todos esos deseos y sue√±os nunca lograre cumplirlos. porque nunca he tenido novia, ni he dado mi primer beso ni siquiera un besito r√°pido y corto o beso de ""piquito"" y nunca ninguna chica se ha sentido atra√≠da por mi debido a mi voz y mi f√≠sico  y por eso talvez no pueda tener novia y tampoco formar una familia, adem√°s soy virgen y tengo la esperanza de que si alg√∫n d√≠a consigo novia ella tambi√©n sea virgen, porque quiero ser por primera vez el primero en algo y ser el primer chico de una novia y la verdad no quiero a ninguna que haya estado con otro antes que conmigo, tambi√©n soy un fracasado y no s√© hacer nada bien, soy muy malo en muchas cosas y eso me provoca tristeza.",0,394

"Traveling to C.R. with a Felony, Consulate unclear‚Ä¶ help!","hello friends, i have plans to visit costa_rica from the u.s. through sjo in the coming week with family for 10 days. i have a federal felony cannabis possession (with intent) conviction that is 4.5 years old, my probation is completed, and i have an unrestricted passport.
  
everything i read online and was told by the u.s. state department indicated i would be fine to enter costa_rica with my criminal record.  
  
just a couple days ago i emailed the  c.r. consulate in la and they responded that i would not be able to enter the country until 10 years post conviction. i did not receive an explanation.  
  
i thought the 10 year rule only applied to foreign residence in c.r., not tourists.  i am wondering if my federal felony makes any difference. 
  
according to article 61.3 of c.r. immigration law, an impediment to entry for tourism would be conviction for a malicious crime.  
  
is my cannabis conviction considered a malicious crime in c.r.? should i heed the advice of the consulate and cancel my tickets?

Questions about life in Costa Rica," 

hello everyone,

i have looked at the topic online, but i worry that some information is out of date, very general, or involved in advertising certain products/services.

i am a native english speaker with a university degree and celta certificate.  
i would like to live and teach in costa_rica.

a) where is the best city? i generally like large cities as i feel this is the most lively, least boring, and the best way to experience the culture (people, street food etc.)... 

b) how much can i expect to earn? from what i read online, about 500-700usd a month. is this accurate? is this before or after tax?

c) how much of a problem are scorpions and other harmful creatures? i hear they are not deadly, but can cause a lot of pain. which cities will they be/not be an issue?

d) i hear esl teachers often work on tourist visas. if possible, i would like to work with a residence visa, 1) to do things properly, and 2) so i can buy/rent a car to drive. is this possible? if so, what are the costs?

e) how safe is costa_rica? from my understanding, it is far less dangerous than much of central america, but not very safe like many cities in east asia. is it similar to major western cities of europe in terms of safety? street attacks, muggings, burglary etc.

f) how much does it cost for a good internet connection? i may want to supplement my earnings by working online, so a strong/stable connection is important.

g) how is dating in costa_rica? is it very conservative? will a foreign man with a local woman be treated with hostility, or do people not care? (if it makes a difference, i look racially ambiguous. i could be mediterranean, middle eastern, maybe south american)

thank you for your time and answering an questions that you can :)",0,320

‚Äúnah ese mae ya perdi√≥ la dignidad. suicidio social‚Äù

‚Äúm√°s le vale que sea el √∫ltimo mensaje que nos manda a nosotras carepicha‚Äù

‚Äútodo mundo sabe gracias a usted y varios me dieron la raz√≥n. metase un dedo entre el culo y deje de molestar‚Äù

...jej. incluso despu√©s de actuar como si ya no le molestaba. incluso despu√©s de estar hablando completamente normal conmigo, en vez de comunicar que eso todav√≠a la afectaba... o al menos eso... ¬øpienso?

...fue innumerable la cantidad de veces que yo le rogu√© a usted para que me perdonara. tantas veces. tanto que yo llor√© por esto, por perder tantas amistades por algo tan estupido... pero... despu√©s de casi 2 a√±os desde que usted me invit√≥ a algo en donde yo pens√© que quer√≠a hablar conmigo... me di cuenta de algo; usted ten√≠a raz√≥n. en el momento que usted me dijo ‚Äúno‚Äù yo tuve que haber parado, yo tuve que haberme quedado callado, yo tuve que haberme puesto en una esquina y no decirle nada m√°s, y yo lo he lamentado por varios meses. lo siento. pero... ¬øsabe que? ...usted jug√≥ con mi culpa, y cualquier persona que diga que ‚Äúno‚Äù es un severo bruto. usted le hab√≠a quedado claro que fue un accidente, que yo no sab√≠a, que yo estaba nervioso. usted fingi√≥ haber quedado bien conmigo despu√©s de las innumerables cantidades de veces que yo le ped√≠ disculpas a usted y al grupo, ¬ø...y pasar esas √∫ltimas 2 semanas habl√°ndome completamente normal conmigo como si ya no le molestara lo qu√© pas√≥ entre nosotros, solo para despu√©s volverme a cagar por algo que usted en varias ocasiones admiti√≥ que ya le daba igual...? mandarme todos esos audios donde se mor√≠a de la risa, cuando yo estaba sufriendo, cuando usted ten√≠a bien claro que ansiedad social y temor a ser juzgado era mi principal inseguridad, aprovecharse de eso, sin tomar en cuenta la mierda por la que estaba pasando en casa por problemas familiares esos d√≠as, diciendo que le ‚Äúval√≠a picha que yo llorara‚Äù y que no le importaba como yo me sent√≠a, que solo me iba a tratar as√≠ porque ‚Äúle daba la gana‚Äù... me hace pensar... aunque yo hice algo malo... aunque yo ‚Äúacos√©‚Äù... me cuestiono si yo realmente fui el malo despu√©s de todo el resto. 

...y de nada ayud√≥ que despu√©s de eso, mi familia, mi mam√° me segu√≠a llamando un ‚Äúin√∫til‚Äù y un pendejo por lo qu√© pas√≥, o a mi t√≠a que se pon√≠a a decirme que ‚Äúnada fue mi culpa‚Äù, en vez de resaltar mi error. no t√≠a, si lo fue. hasta cierto punto, si lo fue, y yo me odio a mi mismo por no haberme dado cuenta hasta hoy en d√≠a. ten√≠a 16 a√±os. yo no sab√≠a. yo solo quer√≠a caer bien, pero yo siempre tuve que haberla cagado, porque es lo √∫nico que sabia hacer.

en poco m√°s de un mes, por septiembre, esos compa√±eros van a ir a una fiesta de graduaci√≥n en unos moteles lindisimos. si eso no hubiera pasado, yo hubiera podido ir con ellos... pero ya no puedo. yo quiero ver a los chiquillos de nuevo, quiero hablar con ellos, pero ya no puedo... por que a pesar de que antes me dec√≠an que me quer√≠an y que me apreciaban, y que ellos quer√≠an que yo pasara tiempo con ellos, nadie realmente tuvo la energ√≠a, inter√©s, o ganas de llegar a un acuerdo despu√©s de lo qu√© pas√≥ entre ella y yo. yo llevo meses de no hablar con los otros maes. a nadie le import√≥ simplemente arreglar las cosas, para que yo pudiera ser feliz otravez, para que ya pudiera hablar con ellos de nuevo... no... y eso demuestra lo que yo realmente val√≠a.

...que gracioso, y que satisfacci√≥n, irme. irme durante esos d√≠as. aunque sea fingir mi hijueputa suicidio, publicar una nota y desaparecer, aunque sea por 5 d√≠as, para que ellos se den cuenta despu√©s de tanto tiempo como yo me he sentido. para que por fin sientan la misma culpabilidad, ansiedad, y tristeza que yo he sentido a lo largo de estos casi 2 a√±os. que risa seria, que todo mundo se d√© cuenta de lo que ella hizo, y que la haga a ella de verdad reflexionar sobre c√≥mo realmente me trat√≥, y que les remuerda la consciencia pensar en que ya no estoy, mientras iban planeando un viaje como si nada... 

yo solo... solo quiero que todo mundo, mi familia, mis antiguos amigos, los que tengo ahorita, que todos, se den cuenta de esto... que por fin me puedan crear. y si el plan fracasa... pues nada m√°s termino en matarme de verdad.

la verdad. a mi ya no me importa nada. solo ya no quiero sentirme as√≠ mas. es mucha culpabilidad y resentimiento mezclado. 

no hay un solo d√≠a que no llore. que no sue√±e en otro mundo donde nada de esto pas√≥. ya solo quiero irme.",0,912

monteverde(2 days) 
uvita (3 or 4 days)  
osa penninsula (4 days)

 also if there is a better order to visit these destinations please let me know.

thanks for being a great community with a lot of great information!

i'm traveling with my family (ranging from early 20s to mid 60s) this may, and would like to get some opinions from the community.

context:

* we arrive in san_jose on may 23, and leave may 31st
* renting a suv for the time
* younger members of the family can do intensive physical activity with altitude, but older members will take it slower

&#x200b;

our current plan:

* arenal/la_fortuna on may 24 - 26
* monteverde on may 26 - 28
* manuel antonio on may 28 - 30
* san_jose on may 30 - 31

&#x200b;

questions:

* is this too much in this short time? how would you adjust the schedule?
* total drive time on google maps says 12 hours for all destination is 12 hours - however, this assumes no problem on the road, is this realistic?

Purchasing property with Cryptocurrency gains,"hi i currently live in canada and i had a few questions regarding cryptocurrency usage and cryptocurrency gains made.

here is the example i am referring to: let's say i own 10 bitcoins. i then decide to sell those bitcoins for fiat currency on a costa_rican exchange. is it possible for me to wire transfer or to cash out that fiat currency to a costa_rican bank and will the bank recognize this tender as legal?

i've seen cryptocurrency is really adopted in costa_rica but i was wondering if selling it for colones or usd through an exchange would be recognized by a costa_rican bank.

if anyone can shed a light, past experience and knowledge on this would be much appreciated

Costa rica travel insurance,"hi all,

in 2 weeks my girlfriend and i am travelling to costa_rica. (saturday 4 september 2021). super excited!!!

we are planning to stay in costa_rica untill the 25th of september 2021. 

our second pfizer vaccination is taking place on 31 august 2021.

this means that 14 days after our second pfizer vaccination is on the 14th of september 2021.

do we need to take a travel insurance policy, with coverage of the stated covid-19 costs by the costa_rican government, untill the 14th of september 2021?

because after the 14th of september 2021 we are fully vaccinated for 14 days or more.


also; if we need to take an insurance, is trawick - safe travels international the best option for us as a dutch citizen? has anyone experience with trawick?",0,133

Question about Cannabis in CR,"hey everyone! 

this might be a dumb question, but i just want to make sure i am prepared for my trip to cr in june. i am a medical cannabis patient for complex ptsd. other medications do not work and are not an option. i understand that cannabis was recently vetoed for medical use, however it is fairly easy to obtain in cr as long as you ask the right people. 

my main concern comes down to how much i can reasonably obtain during my stay being a tourist. i am pretty spoiled with american cannabis and usually it‚Äôs way more potent than anywhere else i travel. basically this means that i‚Äôm going to need a lot more than your average tourist, and i‚Äôm wondering how easy it‚Äôll be to obtain 1-2 ounces while im there. basically what i‚Äôm asking is if i should start looking online for a reliable person, or will i have no trouble finding an ounce or two just by asking around? knowing this ahead of time will be fantastic, because i‚Äôd love to scout instagram for a solid connection before arriving if i need to. ill be staying in quepos and la_fortuna if that helps at all. thank you all for the help!!",0,209

Help me decide which destinations to visit in June!,"hello! i am planning a honeymoon for june 2023 in costa_rica. we are flying in during the middle of the night on june 18 and leave the afternoon of july 3rd out of sjo. so we have about two weeks.

we are very adventurous people, and would like to avoid the more touristy places in an effort to both save money, and get a little more ""authentic"" experience. i have 2 free nights with marriott so might end up in a more touristy place to use those. and to be clear, we don't mind touristy, just enjoy getting off the beaten path too. we intend to rent a car, and i have experience driving in third world countries so i am not too concerned.

we are trying to decide how many of the following destinations we can reasonably hit spending 2-4 days in each location. which ones are worth making an effort for and which ones should be pass on? i have listed locations below and how we have perceived them so far. we don't want to overfill out trip of course, but we don't want to be stagnant for toooo long.

&#x200b;

* **la_fortuna**: jungle, wildlife, hiking, zip line, hot springs, etc.
* **monteverde:** more jungle wildlife stuff, but potentially cooler weather, less people, and more cloud forest than la_fortuna? 
* **guancaste:** a few nice marriott resorts we could spend a night or two at. nice beaches?
* **manuel antonio:** lots of tourist, but lots of wildlife and stunning beaches? expensive.
* **osa peninsula/drakes bay:** off the beaten path, lots of wildlife, maybe not ideal for rainy season?super interested in the overnight hikes into corcovado.
* **puerto viejo:** lots of cool animal sanctuaries. keep finding places i want to stay here. just far away from everything. seems to have a nice blend of everything
* **tortuguero:** sea turtles perhaps? is it worth visiting otherwise? the ""arrive by boat"" thing sounds pretty cool.
* **turrialba:** mountains/highlands. seems like a good location to finish on maybe due to proximity to sjo.
* **cerro chirripo:** i hear this one isn't good during rainy season, but we would be super interested in potentially a summit, or at least spending some time in the highlands. not sure how to do that though.

&#x200b;

i was originally thinking sjo - la_fortuna - monteverde - jaco (one night to use marriott) - manuel antonio - osa - turrialba - sjo.  but i think that would be too much right?

and then i later thought sjo - tortuguero - la_fortuna - guancaste (marriott) - monteverde - sjo but i didn't like the idea of missing out on osa, and it felt like all pretty touristy locations.

i recently discovered puerto viejo and it is rapidly climbing the list as a place worth visiting. but its pretty far away from other notable locations.

How to transfer money to Costa Rica from another country when arranging investment residency?,"hi guys!   
as i already know in order to meet the requirements on investment residency permit a future expat has to invest 150k usd (200k according to some sources) into costa_rican real estate. the question is - how do you actually move the money to costa_rica? can you open a bank account in cr while being a foreigner? if yes, then are you allowed to do it remotely (i mean without being physically present in costa_rica)? if no, then are there limitations or requirements on how many money in cash can you bring to cr? the country of my origin has no direct flights to cr unfortunately, so carrying cash is not a perfect option because some other countries along the way have their own cash import/export requirements, fees and limits. please advise and have a wonderful day! thank you!",0,143

Any recommendations for big day hikes that we can do without a guide? Up to 25km,"we are from vancouver, bc and enjoy hiking the mountains here. planning a trip down to costa_rica and having trouble finding some good day hikes. there are a lot of little hikes here and there, and then longer ones that you seem to need a guide. just wondering if there are any you know of that don't need a guide?

we'd be comfortable with up to 25km with 1500m elevation gain. would want a good payoff though for something that long.

we are spending 21 days in costa_rica and will be all over, to the caribbean coast to monteverde/la_fortuna, liberia, jaco, drake bay, etc.

Going to Costa Rica for 1 month - any tips welcomed!,"hello r/costarica ! 

i am planning on coming to costa_rica for the whole month of march with a friend of mine. we are both french in our twenties and both never have been to your beautiful country, and can't wait for it! 

we are currently looking for an accomodation, and have litterally no idea what to do haha

our plan is to find a spot that is quite central for the whole month, preferably close (+/- 30mn max) to beaches where we can surf at a beginner level. we are in a super chill mood, not looking to necessary explore everywhere and backpack around, but more in the vibe of finding a sweet paradisiac spot and then do 1 or 2-day trips around the country by driving around to discover.

therefore, my questions are the following:

\- first, what's the covid situation like? it seems from here that it is fine, open borders etc., but is there any sign that the situation might change between now and end of feb./beginning of march? 

\- what area would you recommend for us to stay for a full month? 

\- does it seem at all like a good idea to stay a full month in one spot? or maybe to make sure we see the most even in our chill mood would it be better to do like 2 weeks somewhere north and 2 weeks somewhere south and then advise on daily trips around? 

\- in your opinion, what are the ""must see"" ? i googled around and found some stuff, but i think it is always better to have local's opinion!

Help needed after inheriting land in Costa Rica,"we are from europe. a relative passed away a couple of years ago and when looking into the estate we found that her asset manager scammed her into multiple worthless investments a long time ago. we have been to the police, apparently he was a known scammer who is already convicted, most of her money is gone.

one of the less evil scams was the purchase of a 250 acre piece of land in canton san carlos, alajuela, costa_rica. in 1996 she paid a ridiculous amount of money for it, but she does really seem to own it. her name is on the official documents we purchased from rnpdigital (registro nacional).

my family contacted a realtor in costa_rica that they found online to try and have the land sold. however now this realtor tried to scam them so this was a dead end. we don't really know how to proceed and i hope one of you can point us in the right direction.

we mainly have the following questions:

1. how do we get a reliable estimate of what the land is actually worth today
2. how would we go about selling it without getting scammed along the way
3. the land is in her name but she has passed away. how do we deal with this
4. due to a miscommunication we are behind on the property tax. we can pay it now, but the amount seems to be based on the price paid for the land which was a lot. is there a procedure to correct this to the real value so the property tax becomes fair?

ps: i am on a throwaway but have been a subscriber of r/costarica after touring your beautiful country for a month a couple of years ago. we went to many of the national parks, met with many locals and it was the best holiday of our lives. pura vida and thank you!",0,323

2. proof of economic solvency of at least us $ 100 per month of legal permanence in the country

3. a ticket to exit costa_rica within the maximum authorized period of 90 days and 

4. not having an impediment of entry into the country.

as per article 61.3 of immigration law of costa_rica, you would have an impediment to enter costa_rica if you have a criminal conviction for a malicious crime in last 10 years as long as the offense is both illegal in canada and costa_rica. 

also, canadian people with precautionary measures, pending criminal processes for sex crimes against under age people or that have been convicted of sex crimes against minors in the last 50 years.

the maximum authorized period for tourism is 90 days. also, there is no procedure for a visa/permanence extension beyond 90 days. to be considered as a tourist, costa_rica uses the definition of tourism set by world tourism organization that indicates that tourism comprises any activity done during the trip for leisure, business or professional reasons as long as they are not being remunerated or lucrative in costa_rica.

**canadian permanent residents and holders of canadian work or student visas**

permanent residents of canada or bearers of student or work visa duly stamped in their passport that allows multiple entries are exempt from costa visa tourist visa. as long as both the passport of their nationality and permanent resident card or student/work visa has at least 6 months left of validity at the moment of entry into costa_rica.

it is however imperative to meet the following entry requirements: 

1. valid passport

2. canadian permanent resident card or canadian multiple entry work/student visa stamped in the passport to be presented at the point of entry in costa_rica. 

3. proof of economic solvency of at least us$ 100 per person per month

4. a ticket to exit costa_rica within the maximum authorized period of 30 days

5. not having an impediment of entry into the country.

if you have a permanent resident card or a work study visa in canada but it has less than 6 months of validity from the moment of your entry in costa_rica then you will need to apply for a consular costa_rica visa.

**canadian refugee**

canadian permanent resident card holders that have canadian travel document instead of passport because they have refugee status in canada would need to apply for a consulated visa with the immigration authority of costa_rica. 

if you are into **shipping to costa_rica** it is important that you work with a good shipping company who will furnish all the custom formalities for helping easy shipment of goods.",0,519

Me he rendido porque nunca voy a tener novia por culpa de mi voz fea y mi f√≠sico nada atractivo pero conservar√© un poco de esperanza.,"hola, aqu√≠ estoy otra vez yo el incognito solitario. perd√≥n si p√∫blico lo mismo muchas veces o solo cuento historias tristes, pero historias tristes es lo √∫nico que tengo que contar porque la verdad las √∫nicas experiencias felices que he tenido fueron hace muchos a√±os en mi infancia cuando solo ten√≠a 5 a√±os, la verdad a los 5 a√±os considero que fue mi √∫ltima √©poca de felicidad verdadera y sin ningunas preocupaciones y adem√°s en esa √©poca ten√≠a m√°s amigos, recuerdo lo divertido que era cuando estaba en la escuela con mis amigos, era muy divertido siempre mis amigos y yo en el recreo jug√°bamos con peque√±os autos de juguete y con plastilina y la verdad esa fue una √©poca muy feliz, la mejor para m√≠. despu√©s de los 5 a√±os si fue una √©poca feliz pero fue empeorando con el tiempo, en fin volviendo con el tema.

no me gusta para nada mi f√≠sico y tampoco mi voz, la verdad he intentado cambiar eso, he intentado muchas cosas para mejorar ciertos aspectos que no me gustan para nada de mi rostro y  tambi√©n he intentado mejorar mi voz intentando imitar un ""acento"" diferente cuando hablo con las personas ya que no puedo cambiar mi voz pero si puedo hacer que se escuche mejor para los dem√°s, en fin. c√≥mo ya he  mencionado en otras publicaciones he sufrido rechazo y bullying debido a factores como mi f√≠sico y mi voz  pero eso fue cuando ten√≠a 13 a√±os, pero a√∫n me duelen esos insultos que me dec√≠an, me dec√≠an feo, retraso, enfermo y tambi√©n siempre en deportes o tareas en equipo me dejaban por fuera y recuerdo que siempre que preguntaba si pod√≠a integrarme a su equipo me dec√≠an excusas como: no ya estamos completos y el maestro me asignaba a un grupo aleatorio y lograba ver la reacci√≥n de desagrado de los otros miembros, adem√°s recuerdo que una vez una maestra nos dijo de conformar equipos con la persona que estaba al lado de nuestra mesa y una chica que se encontraba al lado m√≠o ser√≠a mi equipo pero le dijeron de hacer equipo conmigo y  ella respondi√≥ de mala manera y eso me doli√≥ porque escuch√© y pues no quer√≠a hacer equipo conmigo y no entend√≠a porque si nunca le hab√≠a hecho nada malo adem√°s la manera en como respondi√≥ me dej√≥ m√°s que claro que me odiaba sin raz√≥n, tambi√©n en deportes siempre era el √∫ltimo en ser elegido por quienes conformaban el equipo o me dejaban por fuera, est√° bien que talvez no se jugar deportes como el f√∫tbol pero no estaban jugando ning√∫n mundial ni nada, que ten√≠a de malo perder por malos jugadores como yo?, tambi√©n recuerdo que una vez hablando con un amigo y preguntaron algo y dije la misma respuesta que el, otro dijo que yo era un copi√≥n y una chica a su lado se ri√≥ y dijo: jaja si por eso nadie lo va a querer, fue algo hiriente en mi opini√≥n. adem√°s intentaba integrarme con otros pero me dec√≠an que me hiciera a un lado o me fuera y me dec√≠an que no jugar√° y deb√≠a pasar solo los recreos, adem√°s recuerdo que lo m√°s deprimente era los 14 de febrero en la escuela todos regalaban rosas y cartas a sus parejas pero yo nunca tuve pareja y me hac√≠a sentir triste, afortunadamente ten√≠a un mejor amigo que compart√≠a la misma situaci√≥n que yo y tratamos de ver el lado bueno y hacer bromas de estar solos el 14 de febrero y me hac√≠a sentir mejor, tambi√©n nunca le he gustado a ninguna chica nunca, es por eso que he tomado ciertas desiciones un poco derrotistas  y algunas de ellas debo admitir que algunas son opciones muy  exageradas  por as√≠ decirlo, como por ejemplo comenzar a usar una m√°scara para que nadie vea mi f√≠sico, la verdad no tengo ninguna deformidad ni nada por el estilo pero es una opci√≥n y otra opci√≥n es no hablar mucho y solo utilizar monos√≠labos como si o no en las conversaciones para no hablar mucho y que nadie escuch√© mi voz, la verdad estas opciones las planee hace poco tiempo cuando decid√≠ que me rend√≠ por  completo debido a que me enamor√© de una chica y vi que tampoco era para m√≠, siempre me enamoro y nunca ninguna es para m√≠, es una tristeza en fin ese d√≠a al ver que claramente talvez est√° interesada en otra persona tome la desicion de que obviamente nunca ninguna ser√° para m√≠ y lo mejor ser√° rendirme y jam√°s en mi solitaria vida volver a pensar que le gustare a ninguna chica porque obviamente ninguna gustaria de mi,  recuerdo que ese d√≠a en mi propia mente tuve una larga conversaci√≥n conmigo mismo en la cual logr√© convencerme de rendirme y jam√°s volver a intentar nada con ninguna chica, porque soy un perdedor tengo un f√≠sico y voz horrible, talvez ya declare mi rendici√≥n, pero a√∫n quiero tener algo de esperanza por lo menos unos pocos a√±os m√°s.",0,841

Positive Covid Test and Aftermath During Recent Trip,"i want to share my experience after testing positive during a recent trip to costa_rica.  it's long but i would have welcomed this info after testing positive.

before the trip:  vaccinated in may.  no known exposure prior to the trip.  no symptoms.  i saw that the country was on the cdc list of hot spots and considered cancelling the trip.  however, having bought the mandatory insurance to enter the country, the assurances from the hotel of their precautions, the plan to be outdoors most of the time, and my stupid optimism from having avoided contracting the virus until now, i decided to go.

during the trip:  masks were required and enforced at indoor establishments.  hand washing stations were set up before entering many stores and attractions.  overall, people were on board with wearing masks but less stringent on distancing.  it seemed the country was desperate for the tourists to come back and the people were doing their part in making it more attractive for visitors as well as keeping government restrictions from expanding.

testing:  two days prior to departing, the hotel in jac√≥ arranged with the local clinic to come to our room for the test - $135 with results promised in about 24hours.  your passport number will be recorded.  there are plenty of posts and resources about getting the test so won't say anymore other than ""thank you"" to those posters.

results:  my test came back via email as positive, as well as my companion's.  this was a bit shocking as neither of us had any symptoms and were vaccinated.  a little later, the health ministry sent an notification email telling me that they were aware of my positive test result.  some time later, they followed it up with the official sanitary order directing me to quarantine for 10 days.  all communications were in spanish and had to be translated.  the order directed that i stay in the current hotel room.  my companion received the same communications, usually a few hours after mine.

quarantine:  we were in transit to alajuela when the emails came through so we had already checked out of the room specified by the sanitary order.  we did our quarantine at the hix by sjo.  not being sure about the ramifications, i did not notify the hotel of our order.  since we extended there by 10 days, i'm sure they figured it out.  neither one of us had symptoms during the quarantine. 

follow-ups:  i received one email from the ministry of health (in english) reiterating the order and asking for a photo of my passport.  other than that, no one checked on us.  no one called.  no one would reply to any emails i sent asking questions, both in english and later in spanish as i became more desperate for answers.  we probably could have come and gone as we pleased but restricted our movements to just two trips off premises to the local super for food and supplies.  after 10 days, the ministry of health sent an email stating the quarantine was over - but to not use that email as an official letter of recovery.

insurance:  had mine through sagicor and had no problems as they are staffed with english speakers.  the insurance specified that we needed to do our quarantine in a hotel previously reserved - didn't really pay attention to this fine print but that's what we ended up doing so this was good.  still need to submit my reimbursement claim.

airlines:  swa didn't care that the reason i had to change my flight was beyond my control.  had to pay the fare difference for the new flight.

letter of recovery:   in order to fly back to the us, you either need a negative test result or a letter of recovery issued by a medical professional if you tested positive.  there was very little information about how one goes about getting this.  it turns out the ministry of health sends this out automatically after the completion of the quarantine.  it would have been nice if they told us this at the beginning - that despite not having seen me or monitored my condition for the past 10 days, a ""medical professional"" would be sending me a letter that i had sufficiently recovered from covid. 

issues:  while my companion got the letter of recovery, i did not.  my countless emails requesting help were unanswered.  my companion twice received email responses so there are people at the health ministry capable of answering english emails - just not mine, apparently.  in one of their responses they say they cannot find me in their system.  i called and got a english speaker after being bounced around.  she gave me two phone numbers and another email address to try.  the email was never answered.  the first number would not connect.  the second number was staffed by a gentleman who insisted that no one there could speak english.  ok, i could have been more studious when i was learning spanish so i could do more than greet people and order my casasdo con pescado.  soon it was friday afternoon and with my flight scheduled monday, i knew i needed a different solution.

there were suggestions that i just needed to take the covid test again but that had risks.  if i tested positive again, i would have to repeat the quarantine cycle - this time with no insurance coverage.  i was in no mood to hole up for another 10 days.  plus it was more money out of pocket for the test.  

on saturday, i went to the 24hr trauma center in la_fortuna (making my way to lir for a cheaper flight and to see the forests) and showed them my companion's letter of recovery and tried to communicate that i needed one like it.  it was going nowhere until the doctor came out and quickly grasped the situation and said he could do it!  he did an actual physical exam and used my companion's letter as a model to construct his own through some kind of official web portal.  he gave me his number just in case the airlines had any issues and then recommended some local hot springs to chill now that this worry was resolved.  he was awesome.  swa scrutinized the letter line by line but it passed muster and i was able to depart.  

in the gap between the time the quarantine was over (10 days) and when you're allowed to fly back (14 days), we did explore the arenal region so that was a bonus.

if you've read this far, you may be going through a similar situation - perhaps there was something helpful in the words above and hope you have a quick recovery.  

meanwhile the ministry of health continues its steady silence.

my father invested ¬£80,000 ($92,000) into this. himself and his colleagues have never heard back from this investment or been able to get any information back regarding this. he has now returned to the uk, and had kept this all very quiet from us and the rest of his family so i am worried it‚Äôs been so long that we really have no hope of finding anything. he contacted his previous place of employment (aliarse) to see if they could at least shed some light on what‚Äôs happened to it but has received no response.

basically i am really after any information anyone has regarding something like this, if you have had a similar experience or have had this happen yourself and what can i do to help him. ¬£80,000 is a lot of money to us and i can‚Äôt just let this slide into oblivion. i am aware there is a good chance that it‚Äôs gone and we‚Äôll never hear anything ever again.

thanks so much :)",0,288

Medical tourism in CR,"anyone traveled to costa_rica for dental or medical procedures? i‚Äôve visited the country twice for vacation and love it there. plan to go back as often as possible. right now i am in need of a minor outpatient surgery (carpal tunnel release) and my american doctor wants $10,000. even with my very expensive insurance it will cost me $4,000. i‚Äôve requested info from a surgeon in san_jose and am waiting for a response. just curious if anyone has ever had this done in cr or had any idea where to start. even if the total trip costs me more than $4k it‚Äôd almost be worth it just on principal because i‚Äôm fed up with this shithole medical system in the us.",0,123
Warning for drivers - Monteverde to Liberia,"i'm going to make myself look stupid here in an attempt to help future travelers. 

if you're driving from monteverde to liberia (or any points in that direction) be very careful which route you take. 

the most direct route, suggested by google maps, is not passable if you don't have a 4wd with high clearance. it takes you down 606 to start, but eventually splits off to take you through candelaria, after which you're directed onto an unnamed gravel road. 

everything is fine at first (if bumpy). soon, though, the road starts to deteriorate - and to point steeply uphill. do not attempt this in a sedan, as we just did. before long, unless you are incredibly lucky, you will probably lose traction, get hung up on a rock, or leave the road entirely. we did the first two, and barely avoided the third. eventually we reached a point, in the middle of a steep hill, where we simply couldn't continue. 

thankfully, a local in a suzuki 4x4 happened upon us, and i sheepishly explained (in terrible spanglish) what had happened - which was, i'm sure, entirely unnecessary. he had a rope in his car, and very slowly helped to tow us over the crest of the hill - and the next one. after that point we were ""fine"" - still rattling our fillings out, but mostly pointed downhill. 

if not for him, we might have been stuck there for hours. it was extremely windy, and starting to rain. if we'd left later in the day and got caught after dark, it would have been a legitimately scary (instead of just embarrassing) situation. 

i know it was our own stupid oversight, and i take full responsibility as a humbled tourist. i will add - another couple came along while we were stuck in some kind of subaru awd, and they just barely made it up the hill. that section of road is uniquely bad, and should be avoided by just about everyone - there are much better alternatives. 

i will also add: i've driven the road to drake bay in a rental car, rivers and all. this was worse. 

you're welcome, future similarly-naive travelers. be careful out there.",0,368

Tips for first time Costa Rica and La Fortuna Visit.,"hi everyone. my girlfriend and i are spending a week, in a couple of weeks, in the la_fortuna area. we are looking to mainly hike, and see the nature and experience the costa_rican culture. we have talked about a horse back riding excursion, or zip lining, but nothing has been booked. does anyone have any recommendations of must sees around that area? we also will have a car, so can drive a couple hours as well to see 'must see' places. 

in addition, i was wondering if anyone had any restaurant or places to eat and drink suggestions in la_fortuna or nuevo arenal.

Question about Gallo Pinto,"hola redditors de costa_rica

because international travel is so difficult now my girlfriend and i have been traveling via our kitchen. every week we pick a random country, try to find its national dish and recreate it for ourselves. we like national dishes because they tend to be simpler with more accessible ingredients. this week is costa_rica week and google suggests we make gallo pinto. just a few questions about the dish.

&#x200b;

1. would you agree that this is indeed representative of a national dish for your country?
2. if not what alternative would you suggest?
3. the recipe for it that shows up the most on google would be the one here [https://stripedspatula.com/gallo-pinto/](https://stripedspatula.com/gallo-pinto/) would this be an accurate recipe in your opinion?
4. is there any alternative to salsa lizano? a bottle of this is hard to find in my country and expensive. will keep looking for it but it would be good to find an alternative if there is one.

Trabajar para una startup EEUU sin emigrar (y ganar en dolares)," 

**tl;dr:** cree un portal de empleos para candidatos latinoamericanos que quieren trabajar remotamente para empresas estadounidenses y cobrar mejores sueldos y en usd. armamos todo el proyecto entre dos personas ‚Äì pagina web, ventas, sourcing, dise√±o, redes sociales, partnerships, funding, todo. les cuento como funciona y como lo armamos.

lanzamos hace unas semanas. tenemos b√∫squedas publicadas, entrevistas en proceso y varias personas ya consiguieron empleos (y pasaron a cobrar 2x 3x lo que cobraban en sus paises - **usd 15k, usd 25k y usd 45k** son los sueldos que consiguieron).

*espero que no sea considerado auto-promocion. lo publique recientemente en* r/vzla *y* r/argentina *y la reacci√≥n fue*[ increiblemente positiva](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/npbjf5/trabajos_en_dolares_para_profesionales_y/h06ti2a/?context=3)*. no tengo nada para venderles a los redditors y se me ocurre que puede ser interesante para residentes de costa_rica tambi√©n.*

* link al [job board](http://jobs.hirewithnear.com/).
* link a un[ tweet que se hizo semi-viral](https://twitter.com/frandpereyra/status/1381024367417638914?s=20) en el que explicaba la idea cuando lanzamos para argentina.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

cree una plataforma para ayudar a estudiantes y profesionales de paises de latinoamerica a encontrar mejores trabajos en startups estadounidenses.

creamos un negocio en 2 meses con un compa√±ero, 100% bootstraped (trabajamos no menos de 12 horas por dia je).

les cuento la idea porque a mas de uno le va a interesar y tambien me encantaria recibir feedback - criticas y preguntas son muy bienvenidas.

# como surgio la idea?

hace unos meses que estoy trabajando en un venture studio en eeuu.

funciona perfecto para ambas partes ‚Äì me pagan el doble de lo que yo cobraba aca (hint: tenia un buen trabajo, finanzas, en empresa de software multinacional pre ipo) y a la vez me pagan menos de lo que le pagar√≠an a un americano con calificaci√≥n similar a la mia. win-win.

asique decidimos crear una plataforma para que otros latinoamericanos puedan hacer lo mismo.

# que es el producto?

se llama **near** y es simple ‚Äì es un job board o portal de empleos.

empresas de estados unidos (exclusivamente), en su mayoria startups y smbs, publican busquedas laborales. y candidatos de paises de latam (exclusivamente) pueden postularse y conseguir trabajos son sueldos en dolares.

# que tipos de posiciones hay?

finance, sales, accounting, operations, software development, marketing y hr.

por ejemplo tenemos estas publicadas ahora:

[ui developer - usd 50k a 80k + equity](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/396/ui-developer/)

[financial accounting analyst - usd 20k - 30k](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/447/financial-due-diligence-accounting-analyst-ecommerce-and-technology-focus/)

[senior unity engineer - usd 40k](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/376/senior-unity-engineer/)

# como hago para cobrar el sueldo?

depende de lo que cada uno decida, las empresas dan mucha flexibilidad en cuanto a este tema. y nosotros nos encargamos de guiar un poco a quienes no tengan conocimiento sobre herramientas para pagos internacionales.

ademas tenemos un partnership con una empresa que se llama deel.

el producto de esta empresa es una plataforma (una wallet pr√°cticamente) donde empleador paga con su medio de pago de preferencia (tarjeta de credito, bank transfer, etc...) y empleado decide hacia donde retirar los fondos y en que proporcion, ej: 30% en **btc** a una crypto wallet, 20% a mi cuenta bancaria en el bank of america, 25% a mi cuenta bancaria local en colombia para pagar mis cuentas y 25% a mi cuenta de wise/paypal.

# como funciona la parte legal de trabajar/contratar a alguien en otro pais?

por lo general se hace un contrato de contratista independiente. esto quiere decir que te pagan el sueldo **full** (sin deducciones) y luego vos te encargas de pagar tus impuestos, seguridad social y plan de salud en tu pais de residencia. suele ser la mejor alternativa ‚Äì la que mas $$$ deja en tu cuenta cada mes.

# near se queda un % de mi sueldo? cual es su modelo de negocios?

las empresas nos pagan por postear sus busquedas laborales en[ jobs.hirewithnear.com](http://jobs.hirewithnear.com/) \- no nos quedamos ningun % del sueldo que cada uno arregle.

les cobramos un monto fijo por job post.

# hay un sueldo minimo?

es algo que estamos trabajando en implementar. aun no hay un estandar de mercado, por lo que vamos observando los sueldos que se cierran en cada iteracion y analizando esa data.

el sueldo m√≠nimo que fijamos inicialmente es de usd 20.000 ‚Äì es decir que todas las posiciones publicadas en near (desde el 25/05/2021 en adelante) no pueden ofrecer una remuneraci√≥n menor a ese numero.

de todos modos, muchos candidatos han conseguido sueldos mucho mayores (usd 25k, 35k, 55k y 80k a la fecha).

# hay alg√∫n requisito especial para poder aplicar?

nivel de ingles suficiente para poder trabajar en una empresa con gente que no habla espa√±ol.

# en que esta armada la plataforma?

actualmente estamos migrando a[ bubble.io](https://bubble.io/) (muy recomendado para los que les interese la movida low-code).

i have a minuscule amount of caribbean tobacco in the car (literally minuscule, not even one joint worth), it wasn't hidden at all and i knew they'd find it if they searched. the one that i assume spoke the best english ""took care of me"" and asked me to answer honestly if i have anything in the car.

from my research i knew the law is ambiguous about carrying ""very small amounts"" and that in theory, i'd be fine, so i wasn't really worried when i said i did and handed it over.

but then he started pulling all these intimidation moves on me, ""we're gonna have to take you to the station"", ""do you have a lawyer? you'll need one"" and so on. 

spends 5min searching through my stuff and asking if i have more, i don't. 

eventually, he's like ""you'll have to pay the fine at the station"" etc, but switches to ""do you have any money on you?"" (he knew i did, he searched my wallet..).

i check my wallet and count what i got, 6x 10k colones bills. he goes ""well you can pay the fine here"". at this point i got the message, handed him the bills, they went straight to his pocket and then he told me i'm free to go.

Moving to From the U.S to Costa Rica,"hi guys,
so my parents are both over 70 and were originally planning on selling their small business and finally retiring sometime in the next year. unfortunately, the current covid-19 situation has completely wrecked havoc on their lives and destroyed any chances of them being able to retire in the u.s anytime soon. in the last year, they lost a lot of their savings trying to keep their business afloat and having to pay for ridiculously expensive medical bills. sadly this means that if they want to retire, they won't be able to keep their house in california and continue to pay for medical insurance. 

recently, i've been exploring other feasible retirement options for them. my parents adore costa_rica and we typically spend around a month a year vacationing in the small town of manzanillo within the lim√≥n province. i've looked into it and they'd definitely be able to afford to live comfortably in cr off of their pensions. so i was wondering how difficult it is to gain citizenship or a permit resident visa? also, if my parents are about to get citizenship/visa - would they be able to access the public medical system there? how is the medical system compared to the u.s? any other tips or advice? 

lastly, any advice about buying property in cr? are there any redflags that we should watch out for when searching for properties?

if my parents end up retiring over there, i'd probably end up moving abroad as well. so, i'm also interested in the public school system over there?

thanks so much for you input!",0,266

i‚Äôm on a month to month lease and my landlords are happy to freeze my rent for a month so that can go toward housing down there. the big question is where is the best place to do it? i‚Äôm probably looking to spend around $1500 for housing, if i can find something cheaper then obviously, rock on. i would be willing to spend a bit more, maybe $2,000 if it made a big difference. but i‚Äôd rather live a little more minimal and be able to put more money into the experience, but i don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why i need you guys. any help or suggestions you could offer would be amazing!",0,162

Duelo,"un amigo cercano y muy amado de quien estaba profundamente enamorada desapareci√≥ en el 2015 en kathmandu, nepal. 
despu√©s de su desaparici√≥n me enter√© que en realidad no sab√≠a nada de √©l y llevaba una vida algo secreta. de hecho quien me dijo era su familia, result√≥ no serlo‚Ä¶ 
todav√≠a sigue desaparecido y la esperanza de que alg√∫n d√≠a lo encuentren se desvaneci√≥ hace muchos a√±os. a veces tambi√©n pienso que simplemente quiso desaparecer y comenzar una vida nueva. 
la historia es extremadamente larga y llena de detalles que me aturden. 

sin embargo a√∫n le quiero y me gustar√≠a saber de su paradero antes de morir. 
creo que escribo esto ac√° porque estoy segura de que mis amigas se cansan de escuchar sobre el tema y no poder hacer nada que me haga sentir mejor. prefiero no ponerlas en esa posici√≥n. 
todos los d√≠as duele y no hay nada que yo ni nadie pueda hacer al respecto. 

hay canciones que sol√≠a escuchar en esa √©poca que hoy en d√≠a son innombrables por lo que me hacen sentir ya que me llevan directo a los d√≠as que √©l estaba. 

uno de mis m√°s grandes pesares es haberle dicho durante una pelea que esperaba no verlo nunca m√°s. se cumpli√≥.

* tenemos la tendencia a pensar que bloquear significa protecci√≥n, pero en la ciberseguridad de hoy en adici√≥n a bloquear, la mejor forma de protegerte es estableciendo una cultura de operaci√≥n de ciberseguridad proactiva y que permita determinar si sus organizaci√≥nes est√°n en contacto con infrastructura de los atacantes.
* en particular hay varios tipos de contacto que se ven asociados a ataques posteriores de ransomware y son conocidos como precursores de ransomware. si sus equipos de computo, redes organizaciones est√°n exhibiento este tipo de contactos, hay que actuar de inmediaro. esta informaci√≥n la pueden consultar en: [precursor malware is an early warning sign for ransomware](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-threat-monitor/precursor-malware-is-a-early-warning-sign-for-ransomware)

Christmas in La Carpio,"as 2020 passes behind us, we look forward to a new year, with new experiences and new hope.  

this year in partnership with #costaricanhumanitarianfoundation and gail nystrom alongside generous private donors and a gofundme : gf.me/u/zb375b which raised over $150, together, near and far, we were able to provide a memorable christmas party in la carpio, costa_rica.  

30 children laughed for the day while being entertained, their bellies weren't grumbling while being feed, and their hearts were bursting with love, joy and happiness.  communities across the globe came together, to provide a day where the sun beamed down on this community center in la carpio. 

gail shared some stories with me that i'd like to share, there were some mothers in the community center receiving presents that day, when gail asked a question to the crowd of young mothers, how many of you have never gotten a christmas present, and all of the young mothers raised their hand.

this year, from that story gail shared, i'm going to remember, that one small act of kindness, may it be at christmas time or not, can really change someone..can help their day, their mood, whatever it may be, being kind, caring and compassionate is what is going to help us through 2021, together.  

a huge big hug to everyone who participated in this project, with togetherness, we can complete so much more and reach heights that our ancestors would have never dreamed of.",0,242

Destination Wedding! (Kinda),"pura vida!

so my wife and i recently got married. we are going to have our symbolic ceremony and party in costa_rica; december of 2023. the issue i'm running into is that half my side of the family lives in costa_rica (to include my many tios, tias and primos). this is going to make the count of people at our ""destination"" wedding pretty high compared to others'.  i believe there will be approximately 80 people that come to the wedding. 40 from the states and then my family and friends in costa_rica. 

my wife and i really want to have the wedding be at an all-inclusive resort that way we can all party for a couple of days, have fun and everyone else can be on their way. the issue i'm running into is that most of the places i am looking at require a certain number of people stay at the hotel. i do not believe any of my family or friends in costa_rica would want to stay at an all inclusive resort for a couple of days.

my question is; does anyone in this sub have experience with a wedding at any of the nice resorts? if so do you know the costs associated with the entire experience? 

also, is there a venue or anything i am not thinking of? all my family lives in san_jose/alajuela so they would have to travel pretty far if i had my wedding in guana or even la_fortuna.

Question to all Costa Ricans.,"to start off i am a canadian citizen, who has been to costa_rica last year for the first time and i'm currently here now again. 

i have a question to costa_ricans.

 do you find that costa_rica is an expensive country to live in?

i was talking with my friend here who i have known for about two years, and she told me that many jobs in cr pay less than $1000 usd per month. a quick google search shows different average salaries ranging from 750usd per month to $1500 per month. 

i find costa_rica to be on par with canadian prices in terms of groceries. cars are also much more expensive here, and gasoline. 

do you have a hard time getting by or do you survive just fine?

Racism / Prejudice Question,"first off, this is not a post to be offensive but just a question because i'm in a new part of costa_rica i normally don't stay in. i have half tica siblings but i'm a gringo with beginner to intermediate spanish. i have been coming here for around 10 years, normally guanacaste, escazu, la_fortuna or atenas. i'm always friendly and thankful type of person.   
i've been in a smaller town for 3 months in the san_jose province, i think there are maybe 2 gringos in the whole area. normally when i'm around ticos it's a great experience, friendly and fun. however, in this town many have been extremely cold, like pissed looking they have to ring me up or upset i'm at their restaurant. if i say hello they say nothing back at all then talk shit after ""gringo this and that"", like i can hear it, they don't care. 

i guess the question is, are there areas that just really don't like gringos around at all? like just even before they walk in the door they are prejudice.  is this covid related, they don't want foreigners due to it in areas that don't rely on tourism?  we have a lot of racism and prejudice in america so i know it's a person trait and not a whole country. but it has been a super bizarre experience here and i would just like to understand it.  thanks.",0,240

saturday:

arrive in la_fortuna around 17:00. check into the hotel. go out to have dinner and drinks in downtown la_fortuna. maybe some dancing.

go on a class iii/iv whitewater rafting excursion in the morning (maybe do combo canyoning excursion as well). return to hotel and enjoy hot springs pools. go out to dinner and drink in downtown la_fortuna.

go on a arenal volcano hiking tour. see the la_fortuna waterfall. do some ziplining. enjoy the hot springs pools at hotel and go out to eat in downtown la_fortuna.

&#x200b;

can you provide recommendations for the following?

1. favorite restaurants in la_fortuna
2. hiking trails and ziplining and other site seeing(such as the waterfall). also what would be the best order to fit in these activities? is there a good combo tour that covers all these?

Advice on Transportation Puerto Viejo to San Jose Airport,"hi all,

just looking for some advice getting from puerto viejo back to san_jose airport.  all my other transport is good and booked and i went the non rental car route.  i have a 1:30 pm flight out of sjo, i have contacted all the shuttle agencies i found which had 6 am departures but they turned me down because they say i may miss my flight due to construction on the road from puerto viejo to san_jose.

i feel like if i leave at 4 or 5 am i should be fine, but they apparently don't want to cut it close with the 6 am.  no shuttle i've found leaves earlier.

does anyone have any advice on private shuttles or will a cab/uber be able to take me earlier than 6 am?  i'd rather not leave a day early to get a hotel near the airport  as i want to fully enjoy my experience in cr.

what options do folks think are good?  i've read a taxi is around $200 usd, which is fine i don't mind paying.  maybe i'll get lucky and can carpool with some other tourists i meet, but i won't hold my breath.

thank you!",0,202

Questions from a Canadian wanting to move to CR,"
hi! as the title states, we‚Äôre planning to move to costa_rica. a group of 5 adults, including my mother which is disabled due to rheumatoid arthritis - we hope that being in cr will help with her pain and mobility. 

we‚Äôve been to costa_rica many times and are quite familiar with the culture, it‚Äôs our favourite thing about the country. the plan is to move in the beginning of 2023, so i‚Äôm trying to do as much research as possible to be as prepared as possible. 

1. pet food/care: i‚Äôve purchased dog food at the grocery stores to feed to the strays, but i‚Äôm wondering if in the pet stores there are higher quality kibbles? we currently feed acana (a canadian brand) so it would be wonderful if there are comparable foods. we also feed raw, like frozen chicken necks and feet - i imagine stuff like that wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to find? is flea/tick medication especially expensive? how about vet visits?

2. owner financing: we don‚Äôt have enough money to buy a house outright, we should have around $40k saved and then whatever else we get from selling the contents of our house. i know owner financing is an option and i‚Äôm curious how difficult that is to find? is there any other options? i‚Äôve read that cr banks are highly unlikely to finance a home purchase for non-residents. 

3. residency: the purchasing of property worth $200k allows you to apply for permanent residency, but how far reaching is that? would all 5 of us have to be on the ownership? 

any and all information/advice is welcomed and greatly appreciated. 3 of us will be driving, my parents will be flying. we have a shipping container that we‚Äôll be shipping with the stuff we intend to bring. my husband and i will also be flying in and renting until we can finalize a purchase, then come back to canada and begin the full move. 

we own 2 companies that we can run remotely for income, but one of us is hoping to do a conservation internship and get into that field.

\- the current phone i have can't be unlocked (i recently upgraded it) so what would be the best method? should i buy a pre-paid phone there? i have at&t and their data plan looks very expensive

\- what are some must-visit places?

\- i've heard the country is pretty casual when it comes to clothing but would i (20f) look weird wearing shorts/typical american college attire? should i stick to long pants for my classes?

\- what are typical gifts people get their homestay family?

also this is random, but directly after my program ends a few friends and i are spending two-ish weeks in ecuador. any advice on what to do with my luggage? we don't plan on staying in one place and even plan to doing a tour of the amazon so i really don't want to be dragging a huge suitcase around (i would like to pack a few things in my carry-on instead).

thank you in advance for all your help! first time posting so sorry for any errors",0,220
K√∂lbi is Ripping Me Off,"so because i'm on wifi most of the time, it took some time to figure out i was being ripped off by them. it wasn't until i started resetting cellular data usage statistics on my iphone with each 5000 colones purchase, for which i'm supposed to get 4 gigabytes of data, that i realized i was running out before even hitting even 14% of that data usage. i wasn't even at 700 megabytes of my 4 gigabyte prepay plan before it shut off my service and said i was out of data.  i'm still trying to get residency so i can use a postpay plan but until then i'm stuck with the prepay plan.  it doesn't even matter that i enabled the save data feature on the iphone and only allow certain (very few) apps usage in the background, mainly signal and whatsapp. i plan to take my girlfriend with me to the store so she can help me talk to them, i'm becoming fluent in spanish but in times like these i get too frustrated to be able to speak it well. has anyone ever had this problem with them? is it just me or are they ripping everyone off?

they're selling me a 4gb plan for 5 mil, but charging me 25 mil and often more for that. sometimes i see in their k√∂lbi app, while i'm on wifi, my balance draining out of my phone. iphone uses only wifi data on wifi, never celular, it's been that way since at least 2012, and this is an iphone 12 on ios 14.7.",0,264

Need advice on planning Costa Rica Honeymoon,"hey guys, i will be in costa_rica next month for my honeymoon. the trip is partially planned, just trying to figure out what to do for the unscheduled time.

the trip will be a saturday-sunday (8 nights). the only bookings/reservation i have planned right now is for tuesday-sunday in the papagayo peninsula/culebra bay area. there we will stay on the beach and see the other areas along the ocean coast and go scuba diving. i am trying to figure out where to go for saturday-tuesday.

on saturday we land at the liberia airport. i was thinking of renting a car and driving to arenal/la_fortuna area. the volcanoes, rain forest, hot springs, and white water rafting are things of interest here for me. would you agree that arenal should be the other area i visit for the time i have? please give me your recommendations for hotels, restaurants, and activities. thank you!",0,153

Thoughts on Tourists,"hi all,

i have been working remotely for a few months now, and i have been setting aside money for travel. i live in the united states, and i noticed that costa_rica has been letting in u.s. citizens for a while.  from my research, it appears as though costa_rica has been handling covid quite effectively. the hospitals do not seem to be at capacity, masks are  worn everywhere, and  additional precautions are being taken to protect the public health. please correct me if i am wrong on any of those points -- in fact, that is solely the reason i am making this post.

for someone living in costa_rica or anyone with insight to offer, what is the current stance on individuals traveling into costa_rica? i am considering relocating to puerto viejo de talamanca for a little over a month. i would stay in an apartment by myself and work from home. i would also go to the beach and the gym. i likely will not be in contact with many people, besides the gym and grocery store when a mask is worn. upon return home to the united states, i will self-quarantine for two weeks and get tested after the quarantine. with that all in mind, should i just stay at home?

perhaps tangential, but i have been living at my parents house  since april 2020. the combination of the pandemic and living with my parents has recently taken a toll on my health. i have been extremely diligent in staying safe during the pandemic; i have not seen any friends indoors since april 2020. there is much more that factors into this decision, but i don't have the space for that on a reddit post; feel free to ask me  more about this in the replies... for years i have wanted to live in costa_rica, and the opportunity is, technically, here. it is a privilege to travel during the pandemic, not a right and i want to ensure i am doing as much as i can to be a responsible traveler (if they even exists right now). i can tell that traveling to costa_rica is an action that i need to take for my wellbeing, but maybe my ego is interfering with the health of an entire country.

tldr; although it is currently possible to travel to costa_rica right now, is this responsible?

any insight or discussion on this topic is much appreciated,  thank you!",0,414
Building properties in Costa Rica,my wife and i want to preserve some land and we‚Äôve been looking at costa_rica. has anyone had any experience building properties themselves in country? i‚Äôm looking possibly buying at 500 acres right now and there are sites we could build on if we chose but i‚Äôm not sure how hard permits are there. i‚Äôd love to come and hire locals if building was possible because it would give use to the other portion of land that wouldn‚Äôt be part of the preserve.,0,84
May I ask a few questions about Costa Rica? My sister moved there last year....,"so my sister and her husband retired and moved to atenas last year from the usa.  my sister has a habit of exaggerating, so i'm just curious about some of the stories she has told me about costa_rica.

1. when i asked her why they were moving to cr, she said it was because there is absolutely no crime and no one has guns or weapons.  i really question this, as every place has crime to a certain extent.
2. she said that there is absolutely no place in all of cr to buy a mop, so she has to use a rag and clean the floors on her hands and knees. really?
3. she said that it is impossible to buy spinach, limes or cool whip in all of cr.
4. she said when you buy something in cr that's in a box, the store will remove the item out of the box and they keep the box.  for example, they purchased a microwave in cr.  they said that the store took it out of the box and just handed them the microwave.  when they arrived home they discovered the microwave did not fit in the cabinet opening.  the store would not allow them to return the microwave, since it was out of the box, even with a receipt.
5. she said when you go to the bank, it takes hours every time, even for a simple transaction.  this seems suspect.
6. here's the real kicker....she is having all her mail sent to me (in indiana) because she said they have no way to get mail in costa_rica.  i find this really difficult to believe.  surely there are expats there that have mailboxes or at least po boxes.

can someone please shed some light on all this?  i'm not going to confront my sister about any of this, because it does no good.  she tells the truth some times, but lies so many times that at this point i just don't know what to believe.  my poor mom is upset because she too doesn't know what to believe.  thank you.",0,353

Looking for the name of some bread,"i went to costa_rica several years ago for a mission trip and while there i was introduced to a delicacy that i cannot stop thinking about. 

it was this bread that was in the shape of a calzone. the outside of the bread was pretty simple yet sweet. the inside of the bread was moist as though there was some sort of sauce. very sweet and absolutely delicious. we got it from a local kid who would come to the church and sell it to us. it was the greatest treat that i‚Äôve ever tasted and am very desperate for a recipe or at the very least a name of what i had. 

i hope this wasn‚Äôt some family recipe and they‚Äôre the only ones who make it. 

any help would be so awesome.

Hi thinking about moving to Costa Rica,"hi i an 46 and seriously considering living in costa_rica. i can probably qualify for the retirement visa but my retirement income would probably only be about $1350-$1400 a month so i am not sure if i want to quit my job yet but i work remote and as long as i can get wi-fi i am good. i work doing imports for a customs broker. i was thinking about keeping an address in the u.s. so i can still pay u.s. taxes etc. if anyone knows how this tax thing works let me know. i have been to costa_rica about 7-8 times and speak good spanish. i would probably just rent one of those fully furnished places for like $350-$450 a month that come with everything. that way i don't have to come with a ton of stuff. i also probably won't be driving either. the taxis there are pretty cheap. if i am missing anything, please let me know.",0,163

San Jose Travel,"hola!

&#x200b;

i will be staying in san_jose for a month studying spanish through a school program. i am also staying there for a week alone before that. as i will have the full month to do the traditionally more tourist things during the school program, i was hoping to do some less traditional tourist activities for that first week. my question to you lovely people is - what would you do in san_jose (or immediately near-by) alone that aren't traditionally major tourist destinations (or maybe they are and you really love them).

&#x200b;

thanks in advance for the help! just to give some ideas: maybe restaurant/street food/coffee/parks/nature trails/views/pretty sections of town and stuff like that. i really want to get to know the city beyond the one or two days it seems most people spend here.

edit: my spanish is good enough to where if an activity can only be completed in spanish i should be fine, so don't limit to english-only!

Helping Contain COVID19 - Suggestions,"so, we are a family of four in cahuita, who through backtracking other family and friends we have had close contact with, believe we may have been exposed or have risk.

we are currently in self-quarantine at a rental and are trying to make the best decision for the greater community about what to do next.  thinking we could:  
a) fail to meet certain personal and professional obligations and attempt to extend our stay in relative self-quarantine (still have to go get supplies at a store, not like there is delivery, but we have masks we can use).  this seems a bit risky with the threat of ""indeterminate no return"" with the ""level 4"" travel thingie.

b) follow the us gov advice to ""return home now"" and risk exposing others if we have it (and ourselves if we don't) traveling back (again, at least we have ""anti-viral"" masks but they are not n95). 

c) find a testing option and confirm we are negative before traveling and/or treatment (two of us are slightly elevated risk).

discussing option c, but we can't seem to figure out if that is possible or how to go about it.  anyone have information about testing and/or healthcare options in costa_rica or where to find them?   would really appreciate any concrete info about cr medical assistance especially on caribean side and/or related to covid19 testing.",0,229

"2 weeks in Costa Rica, need help figuring out the 2nd week","hello! my mom and i are planning a 2-week trip for late january/early february 2024, and it'll be both of our first times in costa_rica. we've booked 5 nights at an ecolodge near corcovado, so with 2 days for domestic flights to and from san_jose on either end that's 1 full week covered. 


we're trying to figure out where we'd like to go the 2nd week, but we're a little stumped. my mom is in her 60s and i have some disabilities (no major mobility issues, mostly fatigue that limits how much i can do in a day) so we're not ""go go go"" people on vacation. we tend to prefer a more leisurely pace and spending some time getting to know a place, but we also don't want to miscalculate and have *too* much downtime at a hotel somewhere if there isn't much to do.


we both love nature and we'd prefer to avoid huge tourist crowds if possible. we're thinking we'd like to see the cloud forest in monteverde, but we're not sure if spending most of our 2nd week there (minus travel days) is too much time there. initially we considered splitting that week between arenal and monteverde, but i'm mostly interested in the hot springs at arenal and the more i read up on it it sounds like it might be more tourist-crowded than we're looking for. since we need to be close to san_jose for a couple days on either end of our domestic flights to puerto jimenez and flying in from the states, we're also considering spending a couple days within driving distance of san_jose (we'd like to do a tour at toucan rescue ranch in heredia) so we're wondering if there are other fun/low-key things to do near san_jose + quieter places to stay than san_jose-proper that still keeps us close-ish to the airport. 


we're also open to suggestions for a 2nd main stop other than monteverde, but i think we don't want to add on more than the one domestic flight we're already doing to the osa peninsula. we're definitely flying into san_jose since that's the only option for non-stops into costa_rica but we're open to flying out of liberia if we end up closer to it at the end of our trip. 


2 additional questions: is it worth doing a night hike in monteverde or corcovado if 1 of us is afraid of spiders and the other is afraid of snakes? i love reptiles/amphibians and i could handle a tarantula and some of the orbweaver spiders but i would maybe freak out if wandering spiders are everywhere, haha. my mom is bracing for snakes in the rainforest in general and i'm doing the same for spiders but we can't tell if a night hike would be too focused on both of those guys. 


also: how common are whale shark sightings in golfo dulce? i would love so much to see one but i'm seeing conflicting info on what season they're around.

Can I drive to Costa Rica with my dogs?,"let me preface this by saying i have no immediate plans, i‚Äôm just exploring what‚Äôs possible. my girlfriend and i are interested in moving to costa_rica from the us. we would bring our 2 dogs, of course, and i would love to be able to keep my car, so i‚Äôm considering what it would be like to drive there. the long road trip through foreign countries also just sounds fun to me, i think that‚Äôd be cool to take it all in. 

is it safe driving through mexico and central america? i do apologize if this sounds pretentious and ignorant, but i drive a brand new luxury car, is that something to consider? it‚Äôs also a front wheel drive sedan, would i even be able to make it to costa_rica in such a car? are there any terrible roads my car would not be able to handle along the way? would it be better to just sell it, buy a new one there, and fly the dogs over?

Solo Travel 6/15-6/21: La Fortuna & Playa Grande | Food Suggestions Please,"edit: does yelp work there? or another dining review app you would recommend?

i will be traveling solo next week (6/15-6/21): first, am open to meeting both locals & travelers! this is my first trip to costa_rica and am looking forward to it.

next, i would greatly appreciate some food suggestions, please, for both la_fortuna & playa grande areas (near tamarindo). i will have a rental and willing to drive short distances if your recommendation is highly suggested.

i enjoy good quality, simple foods. i won‚Äôt mind if i spend my whole trip eating fresh amazing fruit, but would want to try other local eats given the opportunity. i don‚Äôt mind paying for premium quality, but appreciate tips and advice to avoid overpaying too.

any recommendations for the best:
- fruit 
- tacos
- seafood
- local treats
- whatever i don‚Äôt even know to list yet :)   

thank you!",1,152
Best private transportation,"i just got back from a ten day trip to costa_rica and i absolutely loved it. i looked into renting a car, but ultimately decided on private transportation as the safer bet since it was my first time visiting the country. i looked at previous posts in this sub and saw carlos' name keep popping up so i decided to hit him up.

his rates were not only fair, but he's super friendly and made the stay for my wife and i much less stressful. upon arrival, he drove us late night from san_jose airport to la_fortuna. the hotel we stayed at was kinda far from all the restaurants and nightlife so he even offered to drive us into town when we wanted or he arranged a driver for us if he couldn't do it personally. one thing we found out once we got there was that you can't really rely on uber like you can in the states since it's not as widely used. this alone made our stay in la_fortuna much more enjoyable knowing we could explore the city whenever we wanted even though we didn't have a car. for all our other local travel, most of the tour guide companies offer pick up and drop off at your hotel included in their prices so this wasn't an issue for us at all.

carlos also drove us from la_fortuna to tamarindo and he recommended a place for us to stop and eat along the way that had good food. i hadn't booked him to drive us from tamarindo to liberia airport for the end of our visit so i looked into the shuttle that our hotel offered, but my wife and i found the price expensive. carlos came to the rescue again and arranged for a private driver to take us for an even cheaper price.

i can't recommend him enough if you're looking for transportation in costa_rica. muchisimas gracias por todo carlos! u/arenalrides",1,332

Need help regarding San Jos√© to La Fortuna bus,"hi guys,

i‚Äôm a little bit confused right now.
want to take the bus from sjo to la_fortuna in 2 days , and i tried to buy/reserve a ticket today at the terminal.
unfortunately this was not possible, i read somewhere that you have to go up to second floor to a counter, but everything on second/third floor was closed.

i asked some ppl in the main hall, and they were just pointing to the entrance were the buses arrive.

is there no way if reserving a ticket? also i thought only one bus a day at 8:40 goes to la_fortuna? i wonder why people were boarding at like 11:30 when i was there.

second i saw that you can reserve online via mibus.cr but i think that a different bus cause i departs at 8. don‚Äôt know if i should risk booking a ticket there

maybye someone could help me cause i really want to reach la_fortuna, it‚Äôs also not really nice around the terminal : (",1,171

4 Night CR Itinerary,"hello! i‚Äôve recently got my requested days off of work, so i am good to go for my first trip to costa_rica, and my first ever solo trip. 3 nights in la_fortuna, one night directly next to la paz waterfall gardens.

1st day, plane lands around noon. hopefully out of customs and in my rental car by 2-3pm and on my way to la_fortuna. my goal is to reach la_fortuna before dark. once i arrive, i plan on just settling in for the night. maybe get some dinner, walk the trail that‚Äôs on the property of my hotel. 

2nd day: wake up early, and head to la_fortuna waterfall. i hope to be there at around 7am, stay for a couple hours, then head to el salto rope swing for a few hours. after that, i‚Äôll probably go freshen up at my hotel and then get a day pass to one of the hot springs for the rest of the night.

3rd day: i wanted to make this my adventure/excursion day. not sure exactly yet, but i want to either do an arenal volcano hike, white water rafting, zip lining, or atv tour, or hopefully 2 of these in one day. please, if you have any advice or suggestions for these, let me know! i ranked them in order from most to least important to me, so if you had a great experience doing one of them at la_fortuna, i‚Äôd love to hear about it.

4th day: check out and be on the road by 8-9am to my next hotel near la paz waterfall gardens. i plan to spend the whole day at the gardens before retiring for the night in my hotel. my original plan was to stay in la_fortuna for all 4 nights, but once i heard about la paz, i decided i needed to make it apart of my itinerary, given i was trying to center this trip around seeing the natural beauty of cr. plus, it‚Äôll put me an hour away from the airport instead of 2 1/2. but, if you think i should change it back to 4 nights in la_fortuna, let me know. all my hotels are refundable still so if i need to change them i can.

5th and final day: wake up, eat breakfast, and head back to the airport. flights leaves at 1:30pm, so this final day is all about getting home safely and on time

i‚Äôm looking forward to everyone‚Äôs suggestions and feedback! i am beyond excited as i‚Äôve never traveled to costa_rica before, let alone by myself. i‚Äôve fallen in love with this country but haven‚Äôt even been there yet. please, even if it‚Äôs unrelated to my itinerary, i‚Äôd love to hear your input and comments about cr!",1,467

Car Rental or Private Shuttle/Taxi?,"my partner and i are visiting costa_rica in august with my two teenage daughters and our baby. we're flying into sjo, staying overnight at adventure inn near sjo airport, 4 nights at riu guanacaste, 4 nights at an airbnb in samara, and then returning to sjo for a late-night flight. 

other than getting to our destinations we don't think we'll be needing any transportation to get around. i'm wondering if it makes more sense to hire private shuttles/taxis to go from: 1) san_jose to riu guanacaste, 2) riu guanacaste to samara, and 3) samara to san_jose. 

it seems wasteful to rent a car to have it sitting in the parking lot most of the time. and i'll also avoid having to be responsible for the car rental. we'll probably have to rent a larger suv since there's 5 of us, and we're bringing a stroller with pram and our carryon luggage. from what i can tell, the cost would be in the $700+ range. i can't imagine hiring shuttles/taxis for the 3 trips would cost more than that. 

what do you guys think? does it make more sense to hire the private shuttle/taxi or a car rental? i'd also appreciate any recommendations for private shuttle/taxi. if i do end up renting, i'll likely use vamos or sun valley.  thanks in advance for your advice. this sub has been super helpful.",1,233

1.  it looks like it's a pretty significant drive to get from one spot to the other, so does this make sense to try to fit both of these spots in 1 trip? 
2. flying into san_jose seems to make the most sense.  would you go to arenal first, or manuel antonio first?  either way, it looks like i would need to book-end both nights with a stay near the san_jose airport.

we will travel during mid august, and seeing the green fresh forest excites us more than the beach, although a pretty beach is always appreciated. we are a young, and open to exploration couple that enjoy socializing, yet being in not so touristy places. we also have an open budget $$$, for the occasion.

we seek a romantic relaxing, exploration, and activity-balanced trip.

"Beachfront AirBNB family friendly, dinning options","hello y'all, i appreciate all the input given to us looking for a great vacation in beautiful costa_rica!

we are looking for a family friendly, beautiful swimmable beach town where we can get (hopefully) a beachfront airbnb (to be able to walk to the beach) and with enough dinning options around to do the least cooking as possible. planning to do 5 nights. some areas that i am thinking of:  
\-conchal (never been, but really want to, so this would be a top option, not sure about dinning there)

\-nosara (have not been in more than 10 years but i remember the surrounding beaches were beautiful)

\-manuel antonio (have not been, but hear good things)

we are looking for beach time, pool time, eat time, mostly low key.

my boyfriend and i would looove to go to cr. but, the only weeks this year that we can get off together is from 22 september till 13 october. i understand now this is the most intense part of the rainy season.
we don‚Äôt mind rain when it‚Äôs warm. we‚Äôre okay with getting wet from time to time. we‚Äôre also morning people, getting up at 6 is no problem at all. no luxury people, just backpackers looking for flora and fauna (whales, turtle nesting!) and some chill beach vibes with occasionally surf.
my question is, is it gonna be a waste of our time in cr and should we wait for another year? or just go on the adventure?
i heard the roads can be bad that time. is renting a car then still the right thing to do? and areas to stay away from rain-wise? 
many questions. hope you guys can help us out with some advice and experiences!

Best Places to Practice Spanish,"hello all!

i‚Äôm planning on going on a 10 day trip with my family (all adults and teenagers) to costa_rica in mid july. we would like to stay in an area that‚Äôs a bit out of the way without a ton of tourists everywhere, but not so out of the way that there‚Äôs not much to do and it feels totally deserted. 

additionally, although i‚Äôm not totally fluent, i speak spanish pretty well and am really excited about being able to practice my spanish with natives in a spanish-speaking country. for that reason, i was looking to stay somewhere that, save some tourists, is predominately spanish speaking where people wouldn‚Äôt instantly switch into english upon seeing someone who‚Äôs not a local as i heard is common in big tourist areas like la_fortuna and manuel antonio. 

i realize that spanish is much more common in areas of the country where fewer tourists go, which tend to to be the less interesting places (at least in the eyes of foreigners), but was wondering if anyone could recommend places to stay that are mostly spanish-speaking but still have some interesting things to do and aren‚Äôt so underdeveloped and out of the way that it‚Äôs a major inconvenience for travelers.

i was thinking of flying into liberia and staying around playas del coco/playa hermosa (guanacaste) which seem (correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) to have nice beaches and restaurants and a decently developed city and don‚Äôt seem as completely overrun by english speaking tourists as somewhere like manuel antonio. i was then thinking of making some day trips to some more remote locations and national parks and one multi-day trip to la_fortuna from this ‚Äúbase.‚Äù i am totally open to new plans if anyone could recommend some better locations, though.

any recommendations for other areas to stay that are better suited to what i‚Äôm looking for or general advice would be greatly appreciated!

Costa Rica over Thanksgiving,"hi!

i was expecting more of a beach trip but the weather is not looking great for that. specifically in liberia. im not much of an adventurer so this was really meant to be a beach and water activity vacation for me. is that even possible this time of year? even if it doesn‚Äôt rain, can i expect any sunshine at all? im debating if its worth going this week if its so gloomy and rainy or just rescheduling the trip for another month. 

basically, how is the liberia area weather wise recently? would i be better off waiting for rainy season to end?",1,153

Bachelor in Arenal or Manuel Antonio (Or Others),"hello! i am deciding on a **4-5 day bachelor trip between either arenal or manuel antonio**. trip will be next january or february. i thought about jaco, but it seems like jaco is going to be very disappointing.

which destination do people recommend? i like this idea of being able to surf in ma, in addition to being able to do ""jungle activities"" i would do in arenal. i do understand that arenal likely has more to offer jungle wise though.

i primarily care about jungle activities, the possibility of beach activities (which is why ma seems attractive), and at least some minor nightlife for my bachelor.

most likely people would fly in on a thursday and people would fly out on a monday. there could possibly be one more day, but there will also probably be different flight days/times among my friends going.

**i appreciate all advice (even if its for other cities)!** i also considered monteverde (but it seems like this is not the best first time destination) and the tamarindo area (however liberia is a very difficult airport to fly to). one other possibility i considered is using tamarindo as our hotel base and doing a day excursion to arenal to get the best of both worlds (beach and jungle).",1,213

our ideal location would be somewhere where a newbie can spend time learning to surf & have a gym (a bjj gym would be a huge bonus).  


we are looking to rent a home near the beach for 2 months, we are pretty laid back and would just like to enjoy nature, good food & hiking. i would prefer not a super busy spot, but i would also like a place that had some decent restaurant options. 

  
we have travelled to costa_rica in the past and have been to manual antonio, jacko, santa teresa & san_jose. we loved manual antonio and santa teresa, i would say santa teresa was a bit busy though and the surf was pretty huge so it wasn't a great spot for me to learn although i did try to surf every day.  jacko was not what we were looking for and san_jose was mainly just to travel in and out of the country.   


thanks for any input and recommendations.",1,190
Monteverde ‚Äúmust do‚Äù?,"we‚Äôre in monteverde from friday early afternoon to monday morning. our agent told us since we‚Äôre doing m√≠stico in arenal, to skip that in monteverde and instead do zip lining there. now that i‚Äôve done more research, i feel like we may be missing out on more exploration of mv. given our short stay, any tips on a must-do?",1,59
Never been this sick in my life,"hi everyone. i was in cr for 2 weeks and arrived back home 1 week ago. a few days before coming back home i started experiencing abdominal pain. the day after i got back i started experiencing fevers and chills which have continued everyday for 7 days. i've got headaches and now have developed a horrible dry cough. i went to emergency yesterday where they did blood tests and ruled out malaria, and anything bacterial, and they still don't know what it could be. has anyone experienced these symptoms before? or do you know what it could be?",1,98

Monteverde & La Fortuna with a 7-year-old,"hi! i'm traveling with my 70-year-old mother and 7-year-old daughter in the end of june and we're looking for some recommendations.
we only have 8 days, so planning on monteverde and la_fortuna and taking it slow. 
1) my daughter loves hiking and can hold her own, but she is 7 so she's small. also, my mom will require some easier trails just due to 70 years of wear-and-tear.
kiddo loves mushrooms and animals. we all love volcanoes and waterfalls. would you recommend a guide or can we explore on our own?
2) we are considering horseback riding but none of us are experienced at all. any recommendations? looks like some places are on fincas/farms which could be a whole fun thing. or we could skip it.
3) caves in la_fortuna? is that worth a visit?
3) any other ideas for us? we just want to see the forest, eat fruit, and if my daughter saw a sloth it would be the best day of her life (subsequently making it the best day of mine and my moms üòä)

A one way ticket adventure to Costa Rica,"hello pretty souls,

i have followed my dream and booked a way ticket to costa_rica.

my intention is to see where life takes me.

now the reality struck me. you can't enter the country with a one way ticket according 
to the costa_rican embassy. (i'm from belgium)

link: http://www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/48

i have heared there are many work arounds for that like visiting another country so it resets, or get a digital visa, or put 60k usd on a costa_rican bankaccount so you get an instant visa.

but i just really wanna be sure that i can get in the country and free to go where i please. so if i feel like visiting other country's i can just to that. i don't really want to be tied to a visa.

thanks in advance for your advice.",1,138
Visiting CR in september: Pacific Vs Carribbean?,"hey,

i just booked flights for me and my girlfriend to costa_rica for a visit of 2 weeks in september. this will be our first time travelling to central america.

i'm reading that september is the wettest month of the year for the pacific side and the weather is a lot better on the caribbean side during that time of the year. we've visited vietnam, thailand and tanzania during their rainy seasons before but didn't find this a problem at all as the rain really wasn't too bad. is rainy season in costa_rica similar to that in se asia or should we expect more rainfall?

i'm also reading that the caribbean side is more difficult or time consuming to reach and the pacific side has more national parks.
 most posts and blogs have more information on the pacific side which leads me to believe that is the best/more appealing side to visit, which might be a wrong impression?

which side would you recommend us to explore during our trip?

any thoughts regarding these concerns would be greatly appreciated!

Family trip (first time!) to Costa Rica in July. Advice requested.,"hey everyone, 

my wife, 8-year-old daughter, a family friend, and i are going to costa_rica for 11 days in july. this is the itinerary i've drawn up based on online research:

day 1: san_jose (we get in late in the evening).

days 2-4: arenal/la_fortuna.

days 5-7: monteverde.

days 8-10: manuel antonio.

day 11: arrive in san_jose for our flight. we'll probably have an afternoon in the area.

questions:

1) is this an appropriate amount of time for each place? are there day trips you recommend around each stop?

2) would it be feasible/advisable to drop one of these stops and visit tortuguero? a friend has recommended it to us but i am worried it doesn't make sense logistically. (none of us want to surf or zipline. we're mostly interested in seeing animals, the hot springs in arenal, and the beach.)

3) we've arranged to take private shuttles from each location. is it easy to uber/car from our hotels?

International wire transfer recommendations?,"hey friends!   
my partner and i relocated to cr about a month ago and have been looking into purchasing a car. we've done a ton of research over the past few weeks - what to look for, what to avoid, but there's one bit that i can't find enough info on. what's the best way to actually purchase/pay for the car? 

being that we're foreigners (from the us), we obviously do not have the option to finance a vehicle or open a bank account without at least having temp residency status. we're already here in cr, so bringing cash from the us is not an option. traveling with more than $10k cash from the states requires a lot more work than it's worth anyway, and shipping a car here would be a nightmare and a half

that leaves us with: a wire transfer

we currently have our funds with a local bank in the states, not a larger one like wells fargo or bofa (our first mistake lol). 

does anyone have any experience or recommendations for a international wire transfer service? it would be for a 5-digit amount, and we don't plan on having any purchases this large for a while

have been reading about wise, but the recent reviews have been quite terrible to be honest... and i just want to avoid as many hiccups as possible. thanks a million in advance\~

Rainmaker,"i wanted to add this information here in case someone searches this subreddit in the future! i couldn‚Äôt find much info on it when i searched this page. this post was made as of may 2023.

i am staying in quepos and decided to go to rainmaker with my partner on a whim. my expectations were greatly exceeded!

the hiking trail is easy to get to. it‚Äôs about a 30 minute drive from quepos. there was a 6 km stretch off the main road which was half gravel/dirt and half paved road, but it was all flat and our tiny sedan rental car was easily able to get there. they also have parking on site that you can park your car at (if you have a rental) for free. the entrance fee to the trail was $23 usd per person, which you purchase (cash or card) at the main entrance. there are also bathrooms and refreshments available for purchase at the main entrance.

the hike itself is definitely more of a beginner hike. the paths were very well signed and maintained, including maps throughout the trail. for footwear, i was able to do this hike in crocs and my partner did it in chacos with ease. the main draw is all the different pools that you can swim in (hence the footwear choices above). i believe kids could do this hike with ease as well.

the trail is about 3km in total but you can definitely shorten that if needed with all the shortcuts available. one thing to note: if you are afraid of heights then this hike will not be fun for you. there were a few points on the trail where the only path forward was over suspension bridges. they are soundly constructed, but i could definitely see it spooking someone with a fear of heights.

my partner and i went sunday morning right when it opened (7:30am) and ended up seeing 1 or 2 other people on the trails the entire time. the wildlife was decent but nothing spectacular. i would recommend this trail to people who mostly want to swim during/after the hike!",1,357

"Trip Summary: 7 days in Costa Rica (Tamarindo, Monteverde, La Fortuna, Liberia)","got back from a 1 week trip to costa_rica and wanted to summarize my thoughts here as a few friends have asked for them.

**tamarindo, 2 nights**

*scene:* young and touristy with a lot of surfing though during low tide you'll actually see that the beach is full of jagged rocks - my friend actually cut himself on them. plus the waves were pretty aggressive when i was there which makes surfing even tougher for beginners. great for partying - at least on the friday and saturday night i was in tamarindo there were several bars and clubs. that said, i've heard that folks who stayed in other popular beach towns like santa teresa and nosara enjoyed it more.

*things to do:* bar crawl ($25 usd) was pretty fun and crazy monkeys was my favourite spot as it was a rooftop club with acrobatics (think: a very, very scaled down version of coco bongo). cheap surf lessons at banana surf club, $20 or 30 usd for 2 hours. not much to do from an outdoors/adventure perspective.

*food:* tough to find cheap local options as the sodas are not walkable from the center of town. the food options were pretty westernized. the mahi mahi tacos from green papaya cafe were my second favourite meal. witches rock had a cool vibe with live music and it's beach front patio. tried several places in the small food court but they ranged from mediocre to bad. the carribean food truck in the food truck yard was terrible as the meat is literally microwaved. heard good things about the food at el be and coffee at the shop above white lotus but didn't try myself.

*transportation:* shuttle from airport for $25 usd each (1 van shared with 4 others)

**monteverde/santa elena, 2 nights**

*scene:* quite literally in the mountains. much quieter and sparse vs the other places in costa_rica. great for outdoor adventures, renowned for coffee, and most notably the home of a large cloud forest reserve, etc.

*food:* casem co-op was quaint and the tortilla with meat was decent. raulitos was decent as well. sabor tico was highly recommended by the locals but i thought it was disappointing (plus very expensive). cafe choco was a great place for coffee (though contrary to the name, they do not make chocolate).

*things to do:* between 100% aventura (which i did for $54 usd), selvatura, and extremo, there's lots of great ziplining/tarzan swing excursions available and i'd highly recommend doing one of them. i would ignore any claims like ""largest zipline in costa_rica"" because i saw several ziplines throughout the country making similar but nuanced claims. night walks are also popular but the one i did ($25 usd purchased at the selvatura office in town) was terrible - saw a couple interesting animals from afar but was otherwise underwhelmingly focused on bugs (read: boring) and i didn't like the guide. didn't visit the cloud forest or do a coffee tour but those are the other popular things to do here.

*transportation:* shuttle for $50 usd (van with ~6 others)

**la_fortuna, 2 nights**

*scene:* typical tourist town (not necessarily in a bad way) that felt like a hybrid of all the other places i visited in costa_rica. has a good variety of things to do ranging from quiet outdoor activities to partying. as has been well documented here on reddit, you have to pay for pretty much every hike though there are a small handful of free activities.

*food:* my favourite meal in costa_rica was at travesia. while the prices appear high, each meal we got could have probably fed 2+ people. a must try. a close contender because of its low price was pollolandia, which is a no-frills fried chicken chain located throughout the country. rain forest cafe was decent. soda viquez is highly recommended and definitely filling but the food is very low quality and served from a hot table that has likely been sitting all day - i didn't like it.

*things to do:* my favourite activity during my trip was the level 3-4 rafting ($85 usd). it was my first time and a ton of fun, especially for those who like high adrenaline activities. the river level was a bit low though which led to us getting stuck a lot. we hiked through the private volcano arenal for $18 usd which was a pretty decent hike though you don't actually get too close to volcano itself. there's a vendor in the parking lot selling cheap fresh coconuts (1,200 crc) which was a great refresher after the hike. we also did the la_fortuna waterfall for ~$20 usd which was beautiful. the don juan coffee and chocolate tour ($45 usd) which was nice as well, though someone later suggested the northfields one could be better because it's less ""corporate"" than don juan. partying, at least on the weekdays that i was here, was pretty limited. charlie's was the only place open during the week but pretty empty. drinks were cheap though (~3,000 crc per). in terms of free activities, there's a great swimming area with a rope swing, an okay hot spring a short walk from the road, and a free waterfall that i didn't get to visit. also, on the trip from monteverde>la_fortuna our shuttle service had us switch from bus>boat>bus again which we didn't know would happen upon booking but actually made for a nice, makeshift boat tour around the arenal volcano

*transportation:* shuttle for $50-70 usd (don't remember the exact amount) (bus/boat with ~12 others)

**liberia, 1 night**

i know everyone says to skip it but i had an early morning flight the next day and wanted to be close to the airport. next time, i think i'd just stay in a nearby beach town like playa hermosa instead which is equally far from the airport. not much to do and my airbnb on the south side of town felt a bit sketchy. this is more specific to the airbnb itself but despite the great reviews it was terrible - flooded during heavy rainfall, bad smells, and lots of bugs. cafe negro was great for breakfast and coffee, though. also if you're flying from this airport beware that alcohol at the souvenir shops is significantly overpriced. there's a smaller duty free shop near gate 5 that sells the example same products for much less (e.g. 750ml cacique for $15 vs $23 usd)

*transportation:* private driver (shuttles were sold out as we tried booking the day before) for $115 usd (suv with up to 4 seats and the cost can be split by all passengers; driver also stopped at rio celeste, a popular river to swim in, on the way)

**other, general thoughts:**

- everything, especially food, is very expensive. outside of airbnbs and alcohol, i paid more for things in costa_rica than i would in canada. i ate out for all my meals and paid ~double what i would normally spend eating out at similar places where i'm from in canada. same goes for coffee (~2,000-3,000 crc) and other general merchandise items, but food was especially surprising given that even basic meals like casado (read: rice and bean heavy) would run me ~5,000 crc.

- in addition to being expensive, food is pretty underwhelming here. i guess that was to be expected as costa_rica isn't exactly a culinary destination.

- alcoholic drinks from corner stores were pretty cheap (e.g. ~1,000 per beer, ~7,000 for 750ml bottles of liquor), at least compared to ontario (perhaps not as noticable if you're from a low alcohol tax area in the us, let's say). alcohol at restaurants and bars was generally expensive though.

- tipping was not expected anywhere i went. some places, particularly fancier restaurants, do mandate a service charge though, a standard 10%.

- with the exception of my night walk guide who sucked, all the tour guides were great and funny. even the guides that were not great english speakers knew how to crack jokes.

- i imagine it's an anomaly but it only rained once despite my trip taking place during rainy season.

- if you're used to eating properly marbled steaks, i'd skip eating steak in costa_rica. it's generally lean and tough, very different from the fattier steaks we're used to.

- tap water is safe to drink. i drank it everyday without issue.

- navigating is really challenging because they don't use addresses here. it's all relative to landmarks (e.g. 50m west of large statue).

- partly due to above but also because the roads between cities can be terrible, i'd recommend avoiding driving. perhaps if you're from a region without modernized roads then you'd be okay with it but fully paved roads, stop signs, cross walks, street lights, etc are rare outside of the big cities.

- uber is illegal (for drivers, not passengers) so in some less populated areas it can be hard to match with drivers. still worth trying to call for them if you're not in a rush because it was ~50-70% cheaper than taxis (regardless of whether we had fixed price or meter). that said, taxis show up very quickly if you call them.

- related to the previous thought, i was amazed by how easy it was to book transportation around the country through shuttles/private transport. even on very short notice, we paid someone at a hostel or tour agency who leaves a whatsapp voice message with a very vague description of your party/pickup location (again, no addresses), and in every single case the driver showed up right on time. never tried public transportation but i heard it's to be avoided if you can afford it. shuttles/private transport can also be booked online. we used bookaway which seemed standard.

- for some reason you can't convert foreign currency to crc at banks without showing your passport.

- outside of a few small things irking me in liberia, the country generally felt safe, even when walking around tamarindo and la_fortuna at 2-4am in the night.

- tourists are tourists but the locals generally felt pure and nice, truly embodying the essence of ""pura vida"". these aren't great examples but i saw several things (e.g. bumping into people at clubs) that in north america would lead to a fight that the locals just brush off.

- last but not least, and partly a product of hanging around hostels (even if i wasn't staying in them), it was very easy to meet and make friends with other people. there were plenty of people ranging from solo to small groups, backpackers to more mature travelers, coming from near and far countries, and so on. a very different vibe than in north america where it's almost taboo to start up a conversation with someone at a restaurant or on a tour - i was able to meet a diverse array of people just by striking up conversations!",1,1829

Advice for one week Costa Rica trip split between hiking and surfing,"hey all! i impulsively bought a ticket to costa_rica and i will be there from july 15 to july 21. i am flying in and out of san_jose. 

i would like any advice for a trip that will be three nights in one location for surfing (intermediate waves, nothing too insane) and three nights in another for hiking/ecotourism/ziplining. i will probably be renting a car but would prefer not to do too much driving since it's a relatively short trip.

i was thinking that the surf area could be jaco for the surf portion of the trip and manuel antonio for the hiking/ecotourism. what gives me pause is that jaco seems to be a party town with mediocre waves, and i am not looking to party or go out. i just want to chill. are there places to stay near manuel antonio with decent waves and a more relaxed vibe than jaco? 

i was initially looking at tamarindo but that looks like it is six hours from manuel antonio, so i am thinking of doing a subsequent trip to tamarindo. or, i could drive right to tamarindo when i arrive, and then do some ecotourism on the way back to san_jose if there is anything worth seeing.

day 1: san_jose- our flight arrives in early afternoon. pick up rental car and groceries and spend the night in san_jose near the airport.

day 2: quepos- to break up the drive from san_jose to sierpe, we want to stop and spend the day at rainmaker conservation park and spend one night in quepos.

days 3-6: drake bay- drive to sierpe and take morning boat to drake bay for 3 nights. corcovado tour is booked and we may add the snorkel tour of ca√±o island. (will pay nightly rate to leave rental car in sierpe)

days 6-8: matapalo- 2 nights at jardin de los monos. visit nauyaca falls one day and manuel antonio national park the next. 

days 8-11: monteverde- drive to monteverde in the morning, spend 3 nights there. we're definitely interested in visiting the santa elena cloud forest reserve here.

days 11-14: la_fortuna. 3 nights. so far all we have planned is a day at tabacon hot springs. 

day 14: drive to bajos del toro in the morning, waterfall hikes, spend one night.

day 15: drive from bajos del toro back to sjo in the morning for afternoon flight

Having Buyer's Remorse for picking Manuel Antonio over Drake Bay!,"**edit 5/26:** thanks for all the replies! i'm definitely feeling reaffirmed that we made the right decision for our family as a whole for this particular trip. traveling to drake/osa sounds like an adventure in itself, and 5 years ago my parents would have loved that, but now their focus is more on relaxation rather than going on an adventure vacation. i don't think they'd be happy with me if i told them that our trip this year would involve extensive travel logistics into a remote-ish area in the jungle, haha! definitely sounds like my sister and i will have to make a trip back to cr and head to osa/drake/corcovado, though. everything about it sounds right up our alley as we love being ""off-the-grid"" and experiencing nature, wildlife, etc.

**original post:** just booked a trip to costa_rica for mid august and we're really looking forward to it! 2 adult kids & our parents. we're a well traveled family but we have never done any type of rainforest trip, so getting a legitimate rainforest experience is the goal behind traveling to cr. after pretty extensive research, we booked the trip like this:

\- flying in and out of san_jose

\- nights 1-5 in a tulemar casa in manuel antonio

\- nights 6,7,8 in nayara tented camp in la_fortuna

backstory: my sister and i love nature and the outdoors and will definitely be going on hikes, kayaking, etc, but now that our parents have gotten older, they will probably not be doing every activity with us. because of this, we decided on these 2 places in particular because we felt as if they were nice enough for our parents to spend at least half the day inside the room/villa/resort and get some much needed r&r, while my sister and i try to enjoy as much of the rainforest/costa_rica as possible. we also decided on just 2 resorts to decrease travel days and increase relaxation time.

unfortunately, i didn't find this subreddit until *after* booking the trip and tulemar is 50% non refundable (ugh), so we don't have much wiggle room. but i have buyer's remorse after reading all the positive things about drake bay & the osa peninsula! i can't help but think we should've done a few nights there instead of in manuel antonio.

i understand that they are different in the sense that drake bay is quieter, but past that, are they really that different? will we still get a true rainforest/jungle experience with our current schedule, or did we pick out spots that are too touristy? are we going to miss out on a wonderful place? or can you truly not go wrong between these places?

(also, we love good coffee. what are your favorite coffee spots in both of those places? other than red frog in lf - that's already on our list!)",1,480
Help with 2nd location for honeymoon,"we are planning for our honeymoon in costa_rica late july-august for about 10 days. my heart is set on amor arenal for the 2nd half of the trip. we need help deciding where to go for the first half.

12 days in late july -- help deciding between two plans,"hi all, and thanks in advance for your comments.

we are planning to spend 12 nights (arriving 14:30 on day 1 and leaving 16:00 on day 13) in costa_rica. we have already reserved to spend days 2 and 3 in tortuguero, and will be in guapiles by lunch time of day 4, when we will rent a car. from here, i am totally undecided between two plans:

a: drive to arenal for nights 4 and 5, from there to bijagua (tenorio) for night 6, nights 7 and 8 in monteverde, and 9, 10, 11, 12 in manuel antonio. drive from manuel antonio to the airport.

or...

b: from gu√°piles drive to san gerardo de dota for nights 4 and 5 (parque los quetzales), spend night 6 in ojochal, from there drive to sierpe, take the boat to drake and spend nights 7 and 8 or even 9 near corcovado. end in manuel antonio for nights 10, 11 and 12. drive from manuel antonio to the airport.

so, basically, it's either going to corcovado or going to the main sites (la_fortuna, arenal, monteverde). any thoughts that can help me decide???

i had a plan to go to la_fortuna next month on a couple's trip, but realized i was a bit too afraid of active volcanoes to visit. lol.

we're flying into san_jose and know nothing about the country.

if you had to go to uvita, manuel antonio or jaco, which would you choose and why? out of the one you most prefer, how is it to get around? how is the nightlife? can you uber everywhere?

Costa Rica Bachelor Party,"hello! i just got engaged and am starting to brainstorm my bachelor party. given my desire to combine adventure, beach, and partying, i have decided costa_rica would be a great place to go. i want my itinerary to involve **jungle and beach** (including surfing). i assume the trip would be **four days, including arriving and departing but this is not set in stone.**

i have tentatively narrowed down my **two base city options to tamarindo and jaco (i plan on taking day trips)**. in a bubble, i would love to do tamarindo as it seems to not have many of the problems jaco has and it seems to be more authentic. tamarindo itself seems to be nice and arenal is within driving distance. **the biggest downside is liberia airport does not have many us flights and the ones it does have are expensive**. this is even from my fort lauderdale perspective, where latin america flights are usually cheap. many of my friends are flying from different parts of the us.

on the other hand, jaco may have more ""traditional"" bachelor party options and it is **near manuel antonio which looks amazing (while being as far from arenal as tamarindo)**. it is also closer to sjo airport which has a lot of cheap flights and no long drives seem involved. i am **turned off though by some of what i have heard about jaco.** 

**i would appreciate general ideas about which city is better or if there's even a better place to make my base city. i also would appreciate any itinerary ideas.**

thank you!",1,265

Please help with my itinerary 9 days,"hi guys,

finally decided to travel to cosat rica solo in june, and already really excited :)
first i know its rainy season, quick question: does it rain all day or is there a chanche that rains starts afternoon?

arrival san_jose in the evening (2 nights)

* since i will be tried by the flight, i would just chill for the rest of the day, and spend the next day in san_jose for sightseeing. would take the bus to la_fortuna early next morning.


san_jose to la_fortuna (3 nights)

* planing to take the public bus which departs from san_jose early in the moring to la_fortuna. 
as i understand tickets are limited, so would 8am be early enough to get a seat? since june is not peak season i hope this will be enough.
* for rest of the day in la_fortuna i would either visit mistico hanging brides park or la_fortuna waterfall
* next day mistico hanging brides/la_fortuna waterfall and maybye another acivity for the afternoon if you guys have any recommendations?
* next day arenal volcano hike tour, guess this can take the whole day
* last night in la_fortuna and to monteverde next day


la_fortuna to monteverde (2 nights)

* would take the taxi/boat/taxi tour to reach monteverde
* activites for monteverde would be to visit cloud forest, maybye ziplining/bird tour, or you guys know another good tip?
* in all maybe 2 nights

monteverde to manuel antonio (3 nights)

* would take the public bus to ma, it takes like 4 hours but seems to be very cheap. did anyone ever travel to this by bus and know if this is an ""okay"" experience?
* surely visit the national park, and maybe realxing at the beach if this is possible in june. 
* maybye you guys know another acitivity you shouldnt miss :)

manuel antonio to san_jose

* leave ma early in the morning by bus to catch san_jose flight late afternoon. seem to be only like 2 hours

any opinions/tips on this route? did i miss something important or misscalculate anything? would be really happy for some feedback since this will be first big solotrip :)",1,374

San Jose to San Gerardo de Rivas by shuttle?,"hi, does anyone know if there's a private/shared shuttle that does this route? and also from san gerardo to puerto jimenez? i know about the bus routes, but was just wondering if there is a private shuttle service. ",1,38
So many questions!,"we‚Äôre a week away from travel for our family of four. i‚Äôm planning on carry on only and also don‚Äôt want to go broke on new gear for thankless teens‚Ä¶but also want them to enjoy the trip. i have questions re gear and activities. 

itinerary: 
we‚Äôre at la_fortuna for three full days (night walk, one day hanging bridges, one day ca√±o negro, one day free). 

monteverde two nights, 1.5 days (zip line on the one full day, midday). 

manuel antonio at gaia for four nights, three full days (one day at ma park and two free). 

so my questions re gear:

do we need to take binoculars or do the places that offer hanging bridges hikes and night walks have binoculars? 

hanging bridges says ‚Äúno sandals. hiking or tennis shoes‚Äù. in your experience, did keens fit the bill? 

are quick dry pants and shirts a must have for what we‚Äôre doing, along with shells (eek - hot!)? i have all the gear because i travel extensively, but no one else has all. i did buy all water resistant hiking shoes. 

activity questions:

is it a mistake not to do the waterfall at la_fortuna? how challenging is the hike for a lazy teen?

any recommendations re our stuff while at manuel antonio re monkeys? does someone need to stay and guard the stuff at all times? 

rainmaker: nice day away for a couple who will have had 10 days with teens?

any other activity that will have us smacking our heads if we don‚Äôt do it?

Shuttle pass in LaFortuna,"hi guys,

im planning my trip atm and have a question regarding reaching all the tourist spots in la_fortuna.
driving a car is unfortunately not an option, since i didnt drive for years and dont feel safe.
as i understand there is no public bus system, and booking a taxi for every trip will be expensive.

now i found this arenal shuttle pass (https://monteverdetourscr.com/trip/unlimited-arenal-shuttle-pass/) 
am i understanding this right that this i like a hop on hopp off where i can reach all the locations? because its seems very cheap

or do you guys know another good way to reach the typical spots from la_fortuna? im traveling solo btw
would be happy if you guys know a bit more than me :)",1,124

thursday night, sudden bad headache, diarrhea for several hours. terrible bone/joint aches that seemed to roam amongst body parts. possible fever but not a high one. friday more diarrhea and then several vomiting episodes. terrible body aches, severe fatigue, weakness and full body tremors. felt mostly better today, still fatigued but more diarrhea after small bit of food late this evening.

traveled with 3 others. only one meal off resort and others ate the same thing.

what would start so quickly and last after 36 hours of just fluids? simple food poisoning? never had all those symptoms with it before

thanks so much in advance for what to watch for.  ps loved the country and had a great 3 days until staying in bed friday all day!

Monteverde worth it?,"hey

i'm one day in to a ten night/nine day trip. arrived this evening in la_fortuna after rafting pacuare earlier (great trip!)

i was planning three nights here, two or three in monteverde and then a few days on the beach. tbh my main reason for wanting to do monteverde is one of the zipline tours has two superman lines (one through a freaking tunnel) and a tarzan swing (less than $60 too). of course there is the cloud forest too but i don't know much about them, like is the main difference just it appears a bit misty lol?? i'm starting to think maybe monteverde isn't worth the pain/cost of the extra travel.....

so......is the cloud forest worth it? what's extra special about it? is it worth going just for the ziplining?

thanks for any thoughts

travel ?'s,"**la_fortuna questions: (lf)**

1. what is your favorite excursion in la_fortuna? -- looking at canyoning, atvs, club rio, and mistico bridges. 
2. recommendations on something quick to stop and see on the way from sjo airport to la_fortuna? -- this would just be a *quick stop* to stretch and hit the road again. we will be traveling with **ride cr.**
3. is canyoning and mistico bridges to much for one day? (would really love to do a combo tour)
4. is there anything to do inside in case it comes a monsoon as we will be there during rainy season?
5. anything off the beaten path that is cool to see in la_fortuna?
6. is pure trek a good company to book with? 

**tamarindo questions: (tm)**

1. any good quick stops between lf and tamarindo? once again, this would be a quick stop to stretch. and we will be traveling with **ride cr.**
2. can we wait to book a sunset cruise when we get there? once again worried about rainy season and everything says to do activities in the morning, so don't want our sunset cruise to rained on lol but i also do not want to wait and them all be booked before we get there.
3. we won't have a car, so what is the best way to travel and explore other beaches in the area? specifically playa conchal? we will be staying at tamarindo diria. -- i have read somewhere in all of my research, about renting side by sides/ golf carts. *is this a good idea?*
4. what's the best nicest way to keep the ""vendors"" and such away while on the beach? (it gets old after a while) haha.. and sometimes they just won't take no for an answer. 
5. i have read somewhere about the water taxi from tamarindo to playa grande? when you ride the boat over there, then what? lol how do you go explore from that point?

2 days in San Jose recommendations?,hi everyone here in san_jose for two days and would love recommendations/ any itinerary ideas that anyone has!,1,19
Trip Report: Nine Days in La Fortuna and Drake Bay May 2023,"this sub was a huge help when planning our trip so i thought i would share! we did 3 nights in la_fortuna, 4 nights in drake bay, and 1 night in san_jose. we are a late 20s couple who wanted to see nature and wildlife with some chill time.  

accommodations:  

1. la_fortuna- villas vilma hotel
we started our trip with la_fortuna. villas vilma was perfect. it is surrounded by stunning gardens that attract many birds so you can bird watch right from your porch. very clean rooms with good a/c. good location that was close to sodas and the grocery store (easily walkable). giant pool and hottub as well! the front desk staff was very friendly, they assisted us with booking taxis and helped us when we were confused about one of our excursion bookings. also, two very cute cats live on the grounds. highly recommend.  

2. drake bay- pachecho beach cabins
after la_fortuna we went to drake bay. the pachecho beach cabins were a great option for no-frills but comfortable accommodations. they were clean, had working a/c, and balconies with ocean views. we saw many parrots and iguanas just sitting on the balcony. it‚Äôs also walking distance to the beach, drake bay trail, sodas, and groceries. the owner, eric, helped us with rides to and from the airport and booked our overnight to corcovado (see below). he also had adorable dog named balloo as a perk.  

3. san_jose airport courtyard marriot
like every other marriot, pricey but convenient for a night near the airport. they have a free shuttle.  

overall, we went for mid-range accommodations that were a step-up from hostels but not resorts. i would recommend them all!  

travel:
we did not rent a car. we took private transport with u/arenalrides to and from la_fortuna and had great experience. for getting around la_fortuna, we either walked or used the la_fortuna taxi service (you just message them on whats app them, very easy). we took sansa airline flights to and from drake bay that went smoothly (but were late both ways). our hotel in drake bay arranged transport to and from the airport ($30/ride) and transport for our corcovado excursion. drake bay was small enough so we just walked everywhere.  

excursions: 
la_fortuna- highly recommend the full day nature lover‚Äôs 1 tour from green vacations. we went to the mistico hanging bridges, waterfall hike and swim, and arenal volcano hike. juan carlos was an amazing guide, he spotted so many animals we would have never seen on our own. he also shared local history, botany, and more. totally worth it and amazing experience! we also did a 2-hour coffee and chocolate tour with don juan tours. the tour exceeded my expectations, as our guide axel was great and we were also the only two people on the tour. i learned a lot and the tour was very interactive. again recommend. finally, we splurged and did a day pass at tabacon. it was pricey, but i had an amazing time. the hot springs were absolutely stunning and it wasn‚Äôt crowded. very relaxing day. also, they say you can‚Äôt bring outside food in but i had a sandwich in my bag and it was fine (the food and drinks are $$$ and just okay).  

drake bay- the only guided excursion we did here was the overnight tour to corcovado national park and the sirena ranger station. we booked it through our hotel (pacheco) and they connected us to our guide, eric, who was incredible! he had such deep knowledge (born and raise on osa), enthusiasm, and skills. this trip was truly a once in a lifetime experience and i‚Äôm so glad we did it. we saw so many animals, including 4 species of monkeys, 2 species wild pigs, vampire bats, agouti, couti, lizards, spiders, many rare birds (some only found in corcovado), an anteater, sloths, tapiers, and more. also many mother/baby pairs nursing, which was incredible. we watched the sunset on the beach with tapiers. the first day we walked 10 miles and the second day 7 miles. it is mostly flat, but very hot and humid. also, the mosquitoes and ticks are prolific. when you think you have used enough bug spray, double it. i thought i used enough (and it was deet) but still got bit through my pants and got ticks. it was completely worth it though and we had the time of our lives. unguided, we did part of the drake bay trail. i‚Äôll be honest- the heat and humidity kicked our butts this day. we only made it to cocolito beach. the storms the previous two nights made the ocean not safe for swimming, and we didn‚Äôt think we could hike the whole trail without swimming to cool off. however, by our last day in drake bay the ocean had calmed down significantly and you could swim at the beach.  

weather:
we got a mixed bag! some gorgeous sunny days (did not rain at all in corcovado), some cloudy misty days (which was good heat relief), and a couple torrential downpours. i think the perks of going in rainy season (less crowded, lower prices, greenery) outweighed the rain.  

packing:
we invested in some quick dry, sweat wicking long pants and long sleeve shirts from rei and i highly recommend. kept us cool despite the incredible humidity and protected from the sun. also, we packed our rain jackets but didn‚Äôt wear them once, it was too hot. instead we used $20 frog togs hiking ponchos and these worked great. we also got gortex trail running shoes that were amazing at keeping feet dry hiking. we spent more money than i wanted on to gear, but hopefully we can use these long-term and for future trips.  

misc:
- people were very kind, knowledgeable, and helpful 
- i speak basic spanish but many people spoke english, especially in la_fortuna (and our guides for all tours ). in drake bay many people did not speak english but my spanish was fine for communication.
- almost everywhere accepted cards. when we did pay in cash, everywhere accepted usd so we did not need to exchange 
- food was great and healthy. we ate almost exclusively at sodas. best food of the trip was actually at the sirena ranger station
- the one change i would make is maybe staying 1 more night in la_fortuna and 1 less night in drake bay. also, if we had a few more days i would have loved to squeeze in monteverde.",1,1097

LONG POST: Highlights/Tips/Reviews from Nine Day Trip to Costa Rica!,"loooooong post incoming! but i hope to give some people some tips, and also, helps me write down and remember all we did. i hope this helps someone! 

at the end of april, i went as part of a group of 8 friends to costa_rica (six of us stayed together the whole time, two of them did their own trip that intersected with ours). it was all our first time to costa_rica, and many of our first time (including mine) to latin america. i wanted to write out my thoughts and itinerary highlights for this subreddit since i used it a lot in my research! i‚Äôm going to give my general impressions of costa_rica, and some tips that i wish i had before leavings. we were there for 9 days.

general impressions: 

costa_rica is up there as the most beautiful place i‚Äôve ever been to. at every turn i was blown away. part of this is probably because i live in chicago, which is extremely flat; i am easily impressed by mountains. that said, i have seen many a mountain in my time (the rockies, alps, ranges in alaska, hawaiian volcanoes), and i still feel cr takes the cake! beyond that, the biodiversity, along with the climate diversity, made every place feel unique.

the food was awesome, with honestly only one meal being truly bad (tsunami pizza in the la_fortuna area, avoid). not just the costa_rican food, but the multiple cuisines our group tried (i didn‚Äôt go, but heart of india in manuel antonio was highly recommended by my friends). thank goodness it was almost all good, because it is about the same price as in the states.

driving was honestly not as bad as i was afraid it would be. the worst by far was monteverde, due to the sheer cliffs, and massive potholes. the other crazy drive was from bajos del toro back to san_jose, with some insane inclines that our 4wd suv about stalled on a few times. however, those were two of the most beautiful drives of the trip. that said, the last mile is the hardest mile for every trip, and being so close in distance and far in time from every place in the country may drive you a bit crazy. 

while there are many things relaxing about cr, i wouldn‚Äôt call it a place for a relaxing vacation. there are cheaper alternatives to sit by a beach, and while i would definitely recommend having a beach day or two, getting up and out on a hike was my favorite part of the trip.

general tips:

¬∑  make sure you know when public holidays are! we came during labor day, and that meant a lot of things closed that day

¬∑  you probably shouldn‚Äôt flush toilet paper in the toilet where you‚Äôre staying, you toss it in the trash. somehow i missed this info in my research before the trip, but a backed up toilet in one of our group‚Äôs rooms taught us quick. even for people that aren‚Äôt used to this, it was easy to get used to. 

¬∑  sunscreen is expensive! due to flying spirit, which has a lower weight limit for bags, i didn‚Äôt want to take up weight by bringing sunscreen with me. i opted to buy some at the wal-mart near the sjo airport and it was pricy! not as pricy as an overweight bag would have cost through spirit, but there was definite sticker shock. if you can bring it with you from home, do so. 

¬∑  to tack on the above: don‚Äôt fly spirit if you don‚Äôt have to. after you pay all their fees, it really isn‚Äôt any cheaper, and for whatever less money it costs, it probably isn‚Äôt enough to cost you your sanity and comfort

¬∑  ubers will cancel on you in san_jose. a lot. 

¬∑  when it comes to nature, pay for the guide. 

¬∑  the whole country is very early to bed, early to rise. expect things to close pretty early.

¬∑  for most coffee places in cr, iced coffee is more like a frappucino, a blended coffee drink. some places do have the type of iced coffee we have in the states, but double check to make sure you‚Äôre getting what you want

reviews of hotels/activities/services/restaurants (will review all the activities and hotels, but only highlighting standout restaurants/bars):

[adobe rent-a-car](https://www.adobecar.cr/): after reading many reviews, including a recommendation from a hotel, we went with adobe. the price was very fair, about $750 for a week for a 4wd at suv, including every piece of insurance. and thank god i got insurance, because the last day with the car, i backed into a tree and caused a dent. pick up from the airport was a breeze, and even having to fill out the form about the damage was easy. i would really recommend using them. 

manuel antonio/quepos:

¬∑  general opinion: cute town that has plenty of tourist amenities and nature. no shortage of things to do, but it does feel extremely touristy at times. that said, i could have used another day or so here to spend at the beaches, which are beautiful. especially the beach inside the park

¬∑  [hotel villa roca](https://villaroca.com/): this is an lgbt focused resort that mostly caters to gay men, though we did see women and even a straight couple at the resort. there are some clothing optional areas, so be forewarned (though the pool will no longer be clothing optional after the remodel). i stayed with two others in the villa, and the other three in our group stayed in a king suite. i would very much recommend the villa, very comfortable digs. the entire place has stunning ocean views, and the infinity pool is an awesome place to hang out and have the staff bring you a drink to sip on. breakfast made to order was provided each day, plenty of options! they also are remodeling, so the rooms should be improved in the future

¬∑  [mike nature tours for manuel antonio park](https://mikenaturetours.com/): a friend was actually in ma a week before our trip, and recommended this tour company. we even got the same guide, alex! the park is beautiful, and we were sooooooo glad we had a guide. alex was great at spotting wildlife, and helped us take some great pictures. 

¬∑  [caf√© milagro](https://elpatiodecafemilagro.com/): my friend wanted to get a mug for a coworker who had been to cm but lost their mug. glad we went, because the food was amazing, but the coffee was even better. order the vainilla nuez escalofr√≠o, one of the best coffee drinks of my life. they do ship their coffee to the states, and i am ordering some! 

¬∑  [el avion](https://www.elavion.net/): go here for their bar. the old plane is really cool, and the place has amazing views. grab a drink, take some pictures, but go elsewhere for dinner. the food isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs nothing special.

jaco area

¬∑  general opinion: we just stopped here to look/eat. seems pretty touristy and surfer bro-y. i‚Äôm not a surfer, but a quick visit to the beach, i can see why it‚Äôs popular for them, tons of waves. the beaches seemed nicer at manuel antonio for lounging. 

¬∑  [green room](https://greenroomjaco.com/): our first real meal in costa_rica, and it was just great. they had some cute cats lounging, really tasty drinks, and just some excellent ceviche. worth the stop

¬∑  crocodile bridge: on the way to or from jaco, stop to check out some crocs laying out in the sun, along with some nice vistas and tourist shops. 

¬∑  [restaurante nidia](https://goo.gl/maps/tagl2ejvfew96xyb7): this is a nice half way point between san_jose and manuel antonio. we had some great food, it was a cool space, and they give you complementary arroz con leche. standout was the plantains, which included some great pulled pork and sauce to make your own little ‚Äúnachos‚Äù (for lack of a better term) 

monteverde

¬∑  general opinion: prepare for a bit of a bumpy ride to the mountain, with some beautiful views! we were only there one night, so not too much overall to say.

¬∑  [green mountain vacation homes](https://www.hotels.com/ho798123648/green-forest-vacations-homes-monteverde-costa-rica/): gorgeous! though it was only one night, it was a very nice space

¬∑  [don juan tours](https://donjuantours.com/monteverde-chocolate-coffee-tours/) (coffee, chocolate and night tour): we were originally going to do [coffeenjungle](https://www.coffeenjungle.com/) tours, but due to one our other friends we were meeting getting scared away from the drive to that location (her hotel person said the drive was dangerous), we went to don juan instead. the coffee and chocolate tour were pretty interesting, especially making out own traditional cocoa, but the night tour was a bit of a let down. very little in wildlife sighting. obviously, you can‚Äôt guarantee wildlife sighting, but i feel the place was too close to the city for much wildlife to be around. 

¬∑  [sky adventures](https://skyadventures.travel/): one of the absolute highlights of our trip! we did the zip lining and guided hanging bridge tour, both of which were very much worth it. our guide for the hanging bridges, andrey, was extremely knowledgeable. not only was he great at pointing out wildlife, he had lots of great scientific knowledge too. we even got to see a quetzal! 

arenal area/la_fortuna

¬∑  general opinion: so much nature! was only in la_fortuna the town for a moment, but i don‚Äôt feel like i missed very much exploring. i do wish i had more time to explore other parks in the area

¬∑  [tree houses hotel](https://www.treehouseshotelcostarica.com/): so cool! stay in a tree house in the jungle. the treehouses were very cute, and nice (we stayed in the newer treehouses). the breakfast was great, and the service of the people who worked there was awesome. there is also a free night tour of the property, and we saw a lot of great wildlife: poison arrow frogs, the costa_rican green frogs, tarantulas, bullet ants, etc. 

¬∑  [juan carlos tours](https://www.treehouseshotelcostarica.com/tour-prices#juancarlos): the treehouses partnered with a local guide, juan carlos, and we took an all day tour with him. overall, he wasn‚Äôt the most personable guide (by far the most reserved of all the guides we had), but extremely knowledgeable. just have cash to pay him, we misunderstood an e-mail from the hotel, and thought we could pay by zelle. the places we went to were:

o  [mistico hanging bridges](https://www.misticopark.com/): interesting enough place, but since we had done the hanging bridges at monteverde, it was a bit redundant. 

o  [arenal volcano](https://www.arenal.net/arenal-volcano-national-park): the most intense hike of our trip (even though we just did the ‚Äúfamily trail,"" if that is for everyone, i'm scared of the more intense hikes) but the best pay off. we went up to the 1960s lava flow, and the vistas were amazing. 

o  [la_fortuna waterfall](https://www.cataratalafortuna.com/): very pretty, lots of stairs

o  [paradise thermal spas](https://paradisehotsprings.net/la-fortuna/): we ended our tour with a few hours at a local thermal spa and dinner. what an awesome way to end a long day of hiking! 

¬∑  [el comalito torteilleria](https://elcomalitotortilleria.negocio.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral): delicious! we had their special of the day, chicharrons. everything was fresh, so tasty! 

¬∑  [blue falls of costa_rica](https://www.blue-falls-of-costa-rica.com/): we stopped here on the way from la_fortuna to san_jose. absolutely beautiful! the drive from la_fortuna to here, not bad, but from here to san_jose, it is pretty intense! make sure you have a reliable car, with 4wd. 

san_jose

¬∑  general opinion: i got some negative feedback about san_jose from this forum, and i‚Äôve gotta say: i don‚Äôt get it. i loved san_jose! so much architecture, cool parks, some great food and drink! i wouldn‚Äôt come to costa_rica just to visit san_jose, but if i come back, i will make sure to schedule a few days here. just make sure that those days aren‚Äôt sunday, monday or a public holiday. a lot of things are closed sunday and monday generally, and then the monday we were there was their labor day, which meant most everything was closed! this caused us to pack two museums into sunday, which was a lot. but even on monday, we had a lot of fun just wandering around.  

¬∑  [hotel presidente](https://www.hotel-presidente.com/en/): very nice hotel, and the rooftop bar is pretty gorgeous. they are very safety focused, and no guests allowed unless you check them in at the front desk, where foreign nationals have to present a passport, and locals have to show id. this is apparently common in sjo, and i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to prevent human trafficking/prostitution based on all the signs about human trafficking around the city. this hotel is very centrally located, and we were able to walk to most cultural institutions in a few minutes, along with barrio california and escalante. 

¬∑  [pre-columbian gold museum](https://museosdelbancocentral.org/) (which also has some art and a currency museum): loved this museum! so much great info about pre-columbian costa_rican culture, and lots of neat artifacts. the contemporary art section had some great indigenous art, and i was glad to see some since all the art museums were closed while we were in sjo due to sunday and the holiday. 

¬∑  [jade museum](https://museodeljade.grupoins.com/): this is a generally pretty good museum, but i think because we shoved this and the gold museum into one day, and this was second, it kinda ruined it for us. there is a lot here, and you‚Äôll need some time to go through it

¬∑  [alma de caf√©](https://www.teatronacional.go.cr/cafeteria): this coffee shop is located in the national theater, and if you want to see the great architecture and art without paying for the tour, grab a cup here! we got coffee here both full days in sjo, both delicious and a gorgeous setting

¬∑  [neon](https://www.facebook.com/neonicecr): this is a pretty chill gay bar in barrio escalante. they have some phenomenal drinks, and it has table service, so just a very chill vibe. this would totally be a huge hang out for me if i lived in sjo. 

¬∑  [silvestre](https://www.restaurantesilvestre.com/): this was our last dinner in san_jose, and omg, it was amazing! we did the 8 course degustation menu, which was dinner as a show. amazing flavors, plating, and presentation, including stories about the dishes. it was about 3 hours, so book plenty of time. and while this was expensive, it was not bad for this type of haute cuisine (i would have paid at least double in chicago or nyc for a similar experience, and the drinks). if you don‚Äôt want to spend the money or time on the full degustation menu, then go in for dessert and get the osa sphere. both delicious and a visual treat! 

hopefully this helps you make any choices on the trip. it was amazing, truly, truly a once in a lifetime experience.",1,2470
Punta Islita Information Please,"hey everyone, looking at going to punta islita for a month in nov-dec with my 3 young kids and my wife. looking to hopefully hang out on the beach a lot of days and wanting a chill vibe that‚Äôs not so busy. looking to see if anyone has any recommendations of places to go or see? beaches? and how the area is as a vibe? thanks!",1,66
Last-minute Itinerary Help! At the airport figuring this out!,"made an unexpected trip and will be landing in soj in 12 hours. at the airport waiting for my 1st flight as i type this. i am here for 4 full days (may 23, 5 am flight back from soj), will not be renting a car most likely. 

here's my general idea, not sure if this is realistic though:

day 1 
- arrive at soj airport, head to hotel, sleep

day 2- 8:15 am shuttle bus to lafortuna (hotel close to kappa sushi), arrive at 11:45 am ish, leave bags if no early check in, head to lf waterfall (uber this?),  2:30 pm: atv #1 arenal volcano experience (need to book this), 5:30 pm back to hotel, 5:45pm: frog watching night tour, 9:00 pm:back to town, eat, chill and sleep

day 3- 7am: canyoning¬†tour maquique, 10 am: northfields cofee/chocolate tour, 1-2 pm: head to tabacon resort (get a day pass) relax, massages and chill till 8-10 pm ish and head back

day 4- 8am: sky trek @ arenal, 11 am: mistico park hanging bridges guide, 2pm: el salto rope swing, 3 pm: borgrain trail, and then do some hikes (arenal hikes?, not sure if its possible to do after 4pm though)

day 5- want to really see rio celeste, there's a tour at 730 am but my shuttle bus that goes back soj will be around 630 pm so its risky. i could rent a car for a couple of hours and head there myself and back but i'm just really heistant driving there for some reason, not sure how crazy the route from lf to rio celeste is

i haven't booked anything besides my hotels and the shuttle bus from soj to lf. i'm not sure how realistic this plan is, especially day 4 which i'm just winging lol


also, is it possible to navigate to all these places without a car? is uber reliable in lf? getting back from tabacon to lf at 10pm, is this feasible? i know having a car is nice and convenient but i just don't feel too excited to drive in costa_rica lol.",1,352

My review of TEFL Costa Rica English teaching school in S√°mara,"five stars for the experience of living in s√°mara, meeting the local students who are so keen to learn english and the students in the course.  amazing people all around.

i have to be honest though because i had to stop the course after about a week and half due to illness and stress.  i totally lost my voice and was internalizing a lot of anger due to the physical and emotional pain i was going through.  i somehow picked up a virus from drinking the tap water and felt very sick.  on my final day in the course i had an online teaching slot and between technical issues with the wifi (which for a school is very weak) and the very loud construction noise going on below,  i had reached my limit.  i tried to recover but was sick for the next two days and felt horrible.  after another week of pain, headaches and gastrointestinal distress, i stopped drinking the tap water and almost immediately felt a change.  it was like toxins were leaving my body.

i cannot recommend the course to other redditors.  while part of the culture in costa_rica is to tolerate construction noise,  poor wifi,  drinking tap water that may contain toxins or pathogens and even mold growth on the ceilings in one of the classrooms,  a lot of improvements can be made to make this a better place to learn.

i don‚Äôt mean to be harsh but the tension in the school can be cut with a knife,  i saw another student sobbing in her first week and it really broke my spirit too.  i didn‚Äôt come to the school and pay money to see people in suffering like that.  it was the joy the students brought to my spirit that kept me going beyond that point until i became sick.

in my heart,  i felt the environment at the school was mostly toxic and the instruction was over complicated.  you are either a natural teacher and people person or not,  it doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated and cause people to break down into tears.",1,351
Is it ok to travel with Diazepam?,"hi - i'm coming on friday and i have only ever taken diazepam for long haul flights, i'm not on a prescription for them.

i have exactly 4 that i was going to bring to costa_rica - is this allowed? will i need to show anything? i'm now stressing more about this than the flight itself!

(i've googled various things and cant seem to find a definite answer)

thanks in advance for any info!",1,75

Digital Nomad VISA PSA: Most benefits are NOT available May 2023,"# most (basically all) benefits are not available may 2023

### background

the benefits are officially listed here:[http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/busqueda/normativa/normas/nrm\_texto\_completo.aspx?param1=nrtc&nvalor1=1&nvalor2=95085&nvalor3=126839&strtipm=tc#ddown](http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/busqueda/normativa/normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?param1=nrtc&nvalor1=1&nvalor2=95085&nvalor3=126839&strtipm=tc#ddown)

costa_rica's tourist website also shares the benefits here (erroneously:( ):[https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/digital-nomads](https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/digital-nomads)

i applied for digital nomad visa in person in september, it was granted september 25th 2022.the first available documentation appoint which grants the dimex id card was only available on january 19th 2023. i received the card on may 5th - 7th month processing time :)the

**dimex card** is important because: **agencies (besides migracion) require a dimex id to prove your estancia status**

### anticipated benefits (not explicitly listed in the law)

* telephone data plans

kolbi will not provide a postpaid plan, and prepaid plans are difficult to recharge and more expensive (ask me how i know)

claro does provide a postpaid plan **but** it's provided on a case-by-case basis after they review your employment history &/or bank account history. i assume other private companies will do the same - of course claro is 30% more expensive than kolbi.

* home internet

fiber/cable internet cannot be provided in the name of digital nomad dimex card.

### expected benefits (explicitly listed in the law)

1) beneficios relativos al impuesto a las utilidades ‚ùå

* no tax on services used for your remote work

good luck getting the companies that do not recognize your **estancia** to discount your non- existent bill :)  i guess if your not getting billed, your not getting taxed ....

2)  beneficios relativos a la importaci√≥n de equipos ‚ùå

* no import tax on your computers, cameras etc needed for remote work

no import company will do the paper work necessary for this, there is no process in place for this and even if it is possible none of them are willing to complicate their operations for 1 order. **you may be able to do this yourself with regards to cars - i have heard mixed stories and have no experience.**

3)  licencias para conducir

* you can use your driver license (but so can everyone else) ‚úÖ

*however* foreigners legally drive with passport and are able to own, license and insure vehicles **without an estancia** (digital nomad visa). im not sure whats the point of this benefit is, since you already have it :)

4) apertura de cuentas bancarias

* you can open a bank account in one of the government banks ‚ùå

| üö®-üö®- üö® |this is arguably the **most important benefit.**  opening an account w/o limits would allow you to save $$ on foreign transfer fees and atm withdrawals. **i have tried bcr** and even private banks like bp. bcr basically told me they won't open it, i've tried two branches and when i pressed the issue they told me their system won't process it.  | üö®-üö®- üö® |\*\* i think its possible to open an account with some private banks, probably if you have an investment in the country like real estate ...however at that point you wouldn't need the digital nomad visa. maybe it is possible to open a personal account via a lawyer but now i am really guessing.

5) you can stay for one year without doing border runs  ‚úÖ

# summary

you get 1/5 benefits. avoiding border runs every 90 days. pura vidathe digital nomad visa costs 400-600usd for processing fees, about 800usd for private insurance.renewing it will costs 100-300usd. (i can explain the high prices and how to potentially avoid them if anyone wants).

is 1k worth traveling to panama/nicaragua  every 90 days ?
what has your experience been with the digital nomad visa ?",1,596
SJO to Tamarindo,"hi everyone,

i'm in a bit of a panic right now. i have a flight getting into sjo at 1:45 this sunday and need to be in tamarindo by the next day, as i am working remotely from the hotel. everything online assured me that i would be able to purchase a shared shuttle or bus ticket from sjo to the hotel easily, but i am finding it difficult.

every single shuttle leaves earlier in the day, even my hotel told me they are not sure what i should do about that.  the shared shuttled i have been able to book have contacted me saying because i am a single rider they cannot take me.

there is a flight to libera airport, but that leaves 30 min after i get in and i'm sure with customs i'd never make it in time.

i can't drive so that isn't an option.

i have tried to buy tickets for the bus from multiple websites, but every single one is telling me something's wrong with my card. i've used my own credit card, debit card, and my parents' credit card, and still nothing is working. i have no idea what to do as i cannot afford $300+ for a private ride,",1,208
"visiting CR for 2 weeks at the end of July with the family -- 5 in total, 3 kids [7, 9, 14], looking for some honest advice.","i spent about a year in cr as a kid and we lived in the el alto neighborhood of san_jose. taking the family there for a couple weeks this summer, our first time out of the country as a family. hoping for some honest advice.

we planned to hit up a beach in the samara region for a few days and spend another few around arenal. i'm at a loss for what to do with the other days. thought about going to san_jose but it seems there isn't a lot of enthusiasm for that on this sub and that it may be unsafe these days. kinda sad about that, i had nothing but excellent memories of san_jose back in the mid-90s as a kid.

has anyone used adobe rent a car lately and had it delivered to a hotel? if so, was wondering how the experience went please? 

alternatively

i could also stay at the holiday inn express or hampton inn across from sjo and just walk over to vamos in the morning.

basically just looking for the most hassle free way to go about it. 

thank you for your help!",1,97

Travelling to CR in a week. I have a lot of questions!!,"hello all! my partner and i are travelling to cr next week. our itinerary looks like this.

day 11: tamarindo -> monteverde

day 12: don juan coffee tour

day 13: monteverde -> manuel antonio. manuel antonio national park tour

day 14: manuel antonio -> airport

&#x200b;

just so you can have a better idea. i know that ideally, we should stay in fewer cities, more days in each city but we are coming from europe and we would prefer to see as many places as possible, so this advice is already noted (and ignored lol).   


if you have any hotels (not the most expensive ones!) to recommend to any city, please do, as all hotels are booked with a free cancellations and we could still make changes.   


my questions are:   
1. clothes: i understand that we should buy hiking shoes and clothes. is it mandatory to have waterproof clothes? would we meet rain at any given time? how many clothes? i imagine that we could change 2 or even 3 times per day?   
2. medicine. we will bring some basic painkillers, mosquito repellants and sun lotion from our country. anything else that we should bring with us?   
3. cell phone internet. i don't really care about calls and sms, i just want the best solution for data on my mobile phone at all times.   
4. electronic devices. we won't bring anything else apart from our phones. shall we buy specific waterproof cases?   
5. backpack. again, mandatory waterproof?   
6. money. shall we have cash with us as well, or credit cards are widely used? shall we get usd dollars from our country or buy local currency there?   
7. any other recommendation/tip or whatever you believe that we should know?   


thank you so much everyone for your time!!",1,358

Working 6-3 in Tamarindo for a week,"hi all!  


i'm heading to costa_rica for a week on my first ever international solo trip. i chose tamarindo as my home base due to great reviews on a digital nomad hotel, and i'm going to need excellent wifi to work from there 7am-3pm everyday. 

the only problem i'm seeing is that most hikes and things to do around tamarindo are pretty far away, and i won't have a car (i don't drive.) obviously i can walk around the neighborhood and see the beaches and everything, but i'm wondering if there's any hikes or great views within the town, or at least within an hour or two's walk since i can't take the entire day off from work to hike or go ziplining or whatever.",1,126

Silly clothing question BUT‚Ä¶,"we‚Äôll be in guanacaste in july-la_fortuna and monteverde.

thanks in advance-i love getting into the weeds of packing. üòä",1,126
What do locals think?,"i live in an area in the us that heavily relies on tourism for our economy. most of the locals here would prefer that tourists stay in the touristy areas rather than overcrowding the swimming holes the locals use.  same for certain hiking spots.  it‚Äôs just nice to have a few uncrowded spaces left.  so i was surprised to see so much scorn for tourists in costa_rica going to touristy areas like tamarindo. i think if i lived in costa_rica, i would prefer that the tourists stay in those types of areas.  if i stay in ‚Äútamagringo‚Äù i know i will miss some experiences and culture, but i would prefer to not be in the way of the locals.   i‚Äôm wondering how people who are from there feel? 

my other question is about atvs.  i don‚Äôt consider tearing up the jungle on a motorized vehicle to be ecotourism.   don‚Äôt they scare away the wildlife?",1,156

"Just broke up and decided to book a spontaneous 4-day solo trip to Costa Rica this Thursday. I have absolutely nothing planned out, please help","i recently broke up with my gf and i decided to treat myself to a spontaneous trip to costa_rica this week. just needed to get away from all this and treat myself to something nice. 

i'm visiting from canada and i'm aware that its the start of the rainy season here. i've heard it's not continuous rain so i'll have time to do activities and stuff in between days. also, 4 days is not much but it's better than staying here during the long weekend sulking and being depressed lol. 

i'll be landing in san_jose this thursday around 9 pm and my return flight is at 5 am tuesday morning (also from san_jose). so, i have to plan accordingly based on these times. 

things that interest me:

- ziplining (want to try this so bad, first timer!)

- volcanos (super cool, always wanted to see one!)

- hot springs (love these, went to a couple in japan!)

- atv tours perhaps?

- manuel antonio national park 

- cloud forest? 

these are things that stood out to me at first glance researching but would love it if somebody could suggest other worthwhile activities to do as a solo man. should i book these online from a reputable source or do i get there and book stuff on the fly?

i'm not sure if its worth renting out  a car, not really looking forward to driving in an unknown country with no idea of how the rules and traffic work, especially with the crazy roads there. so, i'll be looking for car rides, bus services, or whatever that could get me to different cities. 

from my research, i think la_fortuna fits the bill for what i'm looking for and since i have only 4 days maybe staying just there is worth it? i do want to visit as much of the iconic places as possible, so wont mind doing day trips if it makes sense to do so. i think rio celeste makes sense for a day trip?

also, since i have a super early morning flight back to canada from san_jose, would it make sense to have a hotel in san_jose on monday? or i'm thinking that i can head straight to the san_jose airport from la_fortuna and get there by 2-3 am and just chill at the lounge till my flight and avoid paying the extra night hotel cost. i could just leave my bags with the hotel  reception for monday and pick them up when i head back to san_jose to fly out.

other advice: hotel recommendations (looking at tabacon, but its super pricey for me, also im solo so not sure if its worth it but i do want to experience the hot springs there so maybe get a day pass?, anything i should pack for the trip, is credit card accepted or should i have cash in hand? should i bring cash or just withdraw from atm? anything i should know of beforehand?

sorry, i know this has been asked a million times but i only have 2 days left and i just booked this random trip that i'm super excited about out of the blue. hope this trip helps me move past this difficult time in my life right now.",1,553

i have a preference to rent a car for travel between locations, but my gf would prefer shuttle (so we will probably shuttle). we are not big partiers. we enjoy wildlife, nature, hikes, and also want some time in relaxing locations (beach, mountain, or jungle). also prefer less touristy locations, so open to recommendations here as well. no interest in staying in cities. still in the process of filling in activities for each site.

Advice on driving from Monteverde to Santa Teresa,"hi guys,

i'm currently in monteverde and will be leaving in a couple days to santa teresa. i'm hoping for some advice on the best way to get to santa teresa. on google maps and waze it shows that i can get there from driving to the 145 from monteverde and then onto the 18, 21, then 160 down to santa teresa (along the coast) in about 4.5 hours. how safe and feasible is this drive? we have an suv with some decent clearance, and made it fine from la_fortuna to monteverde today (went slow and avoided the pot holes).

google maps also shows the option of going to puntarenas and taking the ferry. it says it is longer at 5ish hours and we'd have to wait for the ferry. we are also going to manuel antonio after santa teresa and will be taking the ferry at the point. so hoping we can make the drive listed above but would love to hear from anyone who's done that drive before on what the conditions are like. thanks!!",1,178
Can I bring this to Costa Rica?,"hi there! could use some thoughts on something.

the materials are: a small scale (the length of an iphone), a vacuum sealed bag of 500 empty capsules, and an 11 piece tool used to fill the capsules.

i want to help him out, but i do not want to get caught up in customs. is this something you think i will be stopped for?

are 9 nights enough?

this is our tentative plans so far but we have not officially booked it so it can be changed:

day 1: fly into sjo, land around 1pm. private driver to nayara tented camp about 3 hours away in la_fortuna. stay here for 4 nights.

day 5: leave la_fortuna for the four seasons papagayo peninsula via private driver which is also i believe about 3 hours away and will stay here for 4 nights. i heard they have an amazing surfing program here.

day 9: fly out of lir airport about an hour away.

would love all suggestions and although both of these resorts look amazing, we are open to staying  other places, especially on the coast. i wouldn't mind a hotel/resort on the coast that is smaller and more walkable to a town. thanks!

Need help finding a destination for my trip (June 20th-July 20th)?,"hey everyone,

my (21 f) girlfriend (21f) and i bought tickets to cr to stay for a month getaway to celebrate her college graduation and both of our birthdays. we‚Äôre really excited to travel there, however, it‚Äôs both of our first times and we don‚Äôt know that many people who‚Äôve traveled there before so we‚Äôre not sure where we should stay. we‚Äôre both die by the sun beach goers and we don‚Äôt really want be in a crowded/ over touristy area during our stay. the two destinations that have appealed to us the most during our research are puerto viejo de talamanca and tamarindo. i realize that the pacific side and caribbean side have completely different vibes. so which town/area would you suggest for someone who wants a chill, immersive experience while also being near the prettiest beaches. if there are any other areas besides these two destinations that would be better for us, please let me know! 

some things to note about us:
- #1 activity will definitely be swimming everyday or exploring the forests
- we‚Äôre 21 so we‚Äôd love there to be a cool nightlife scene (but we‚Äôd sacrifice that if that‚Äôs only in overpopulated areas)
- we‚Äôre gay (obviously) so we‚Äôd like to go to a relatively lgbt friendly place. although we‚Äôre from the us, which i heard has way more homophobia than cr overall. 
- i‚Äôm black and my girlfriend is afro-latina. while it‚Äôs not important to see people like us everywhere, it would be kinda cool (which is more frequent on the caribbean side)
- we‚Äôre both from california, which means we love the beach and want to go where the water is nicest and most blue
- we don‚Äôt really plan on having a rental car during the month and want to rely on public transport or taxi/uber drivers. so we want to be in an area where we wouldn‚Äôt want to leave often

Liberia -> Arenal recap,"this sub has been super helpful to me so repaying this forward. we‚Äôre wrapping up our arenal portion of our vacation heading to monteverde. 

day 1: land in liberia ~2pm. we had carry on bags and got through customs in less than 15 mins. we had our hotel info, return itinerary and passports handy. 

got a rental car through adobe (w/ 10% off, a free sim and a free small cooler). the office was a short shuttle ride away from lir. the car was clean and in great shape. 

we spent our first night in bijagua de upula at casitas tenorio. incredible small hotel ‚Äî we‚Äôd come back to this area. we just booked one night as we weren‚Äôt sure the light would cooperate for the full drive to la_fortuna but so glad we did. great hospitality and incredible for birders. there‚Äôs a small trail but we saw many birds (toucans, hummingbirds, montezuma oropendolas etc). we even saw a sloth ! there is an unpaved road to the hotel - but easy to navigate when driving slowly. plenty of typical costa_rican sodas for dinner and breakfast is included. there‚Äôs also a free farm tour at 7 am. 

day 2: the next day we checked out and headed to rio celeste which was a quick ~25 mins drive from our casita.  to do the whole trek (catarata-> te√±idero) took us 1.5 hours in / 50 mins out. pay $4 to park and about $12 per person to enter. the steps are a great workout ! grab a pipa fria (cold coconut water) on the way out. 

then we drove another 2 hours to arenal observatory lodge (aol). thanks to the birders in this sub for the suggestion.  

day 3/4: birding in arenal area. we booked an all day tour at aol and el silencio. we saw 78 species over a very warm day. we then got a tour to mistico hanging bridges. this was much more productive at around 30 new species in 3 hours. 

aol is a paradise for birders. i am so glad we‚Äôre staying here. the rooms are simple but there is good hot water, comfortable beds and reliable wi-fi. there is an unpaved road towards the hotel but this adds to the charm of being the only hotel in the arenal volcano national park. good thing the food at the hotel is good! 

day 4 :tabacon hot spring - believe the hype. this place is great to relax and is beautiful to boot. 

restaurants:
- restaurant nene: incredible ceviche. 
- red frog cafe: yummy coffee (wish it was stronger) and great costa_rican dishes. get the chalupa (nothing like the taco bell kind). 
-spectacolar cantina: just ok tacos 

general costa_rica thoughts:
- the roads are both as bad and better than i anticipated. plan for traffic and dirt roads. 
- everyone is super nice so far and very easy to talk to. 

more to come ! let me know if any questions",1,498
Itinerary Check for Mid-May,"hello! my husband and i will be going to cr for the first time in mid may. a bit about us and our must-dos for this trip: we are adventurous (aged 29/32) but not too wild, in decent shape, and eat vegetarian/pescatarian. we will have a 4x4 rental car since we like having that freedom. we want to do: beginner surfing lesson, see a volcano, do a coffee tour (we live in portland or and love coffee), zipline (just me), see/swim/hike to waterfall(s), and get some beach time (but not too much). 

a few questions:
does anyone have any recs for zipline tours that are good for a person to tag along? my husband has no interest in doing a zipline, but that's one of my must-dos, and i would hate to leave him at our airbnb that whole time. i saw the zip coaster on google which would be good for that but i really want the full experience.

is it reasonable to do a trip to uvita/nauyauca from quepos? i debated getting a different airbnb in the uvita area the last night but i love the convenience of staying in one place.

the airbnbs are flexible if i really need to change it around. nothing is booked as far as activities go.

tia for any suggestions :)

day 1:arrive late at night, hotel near sjo

day 2: drive to the poas area. along the way, stop at a coffee farm (either doka estate or finca sircof), options for cinchona waterfall trails, laguna hule, territorio de zaguates (dog sanctuary), check into poas airbnb

day 3: 8am am poas volcano observation, then driving day to quepos area. stop at crocodile bridge, stop for lunch in jaco, stop at other points of interests we find.
check in to quepos airbnb 

day 4: wildlife tour at ma, hang at the beach

7 full days itinerary--please help!,"hello! i will be traveling to costa_rica at the end of may for 9 days. i will be traveling alone (late 20s female), and will be using buses or shuttles, not renting a car. i have 9 days total but some are travel days. i feel like this itinerary is probably a little ambitious, but i don't know what to cut from it, if anything. i'd appreciate any help!

a little bit about my travel style: looking for adventure and nature. active and typically physically exhausted after vacations (in the best way). i'm an experienced traveler (but out of practice now) and don't love super touristy things but with the limited time i have, tours/guides might just be the most convenient. very much budget accommodations/food with the goal of spending more on experiences. not big into nightlife. 

day 1: fly in. arrive super late in the evening. straight from airport to hostel (or maybe stay in airport if i want to save money).

day 2: shuttle to la_fortuna. get there early afternoon. arenal volcano hike maybe? but worried i wouldn't have enough time starting later in the day.

day 3: la_fortuna (maybe something adventure like canyoneering or white water rafting, end the day with hot springs)

day 4: la_fortuna road-boat-road to monteverde. arrive early afternoon. visit one of the cloud forests and do a night walking tour.

day 5: monteverde--ziplining and the hanging bridges. i also saw a horseback riding tour which looked cool? idk. 

day 6: monteverde to manuel antonio (arrive early afternoon). maybe do snorkeling or scuba? 

day 7: manuel antonio national park

day 8: i really want to try surfing in the am, but in the afternoon, need to head back to san_jose

day 9: fly home 

i was thinking about cutting monteverde because it seems the least popular, but then everything i read said it was quieter and had fewer people than la_fortuna, plus i feel like the biodiversity is so incredibly unique. then i was thinking about cutting manuel antonio, but i don't really live near any warm beaches in the u.s, plus i've always wanted to try surfing. but i'm not sure how nice the beach will be at the end of may or if it will be too rainy)? thought about cutting la_fortuna because it seems the most touristy, but it also seems to be the place for adventure stuff, which is something i enjoy. is there anything really stunning to see in la_fortuna (i guess the volcano)? or could i do some of the adventure stuff i want to do in monteverde as well?

Question about Costa Rican Dialect.,"i have read that costa_ricans put tico/ tica after every single word so, un pocco becomes un poqutico, or perro is pertico. is this really true, is it only in certain regions or the whole country?

How hot and buggy?,"we're heading to cr memorial day weekend for 12 days. we have a few nights in la_fortuna, two nights in monteverde, and then a few in manuel antonio (gaia). it's just the beginning of the rainy season and i'm not sure just how buggy (mosquitos) it will be in all areas and if that's really something to worry about in the evening and/or when in forests vs 24/7. my kids, both teens, are some incredible treat for mosquitos and end up with welts. yes, we have strong bug spray and even permethrin pants from exofficio. do i need to cover them with spray wherever we go and whenever we go, swaddle them in bug-proof materials....or are the beaches or midday hours more mosquito free? and heat question...we're from the west coast of the u.s.. is the humidity more like guatemala or more like the gates of hell? aka florida in july?",1,152
"Flamingo, Brasilito, Potrero, Fishing, and surfing!","heading to this area with my partner and parents mid-june for 3 days. we've been to tamarindo before, but prefer quieter, more local feeling spots. last time we stayed at the rip-jack inn on playa grande and it was nice but felt a little too isolated.

i spent the day on playa flamingo last time i was there and really loved it. nice beach, can park close, guys bring you a tent, chairs, and drinks. is this common at most beaches? it was lovely! 

we are not sure where to stay this time, but will have a car so can get around easily.

i guess we are looking for the following:

*  close to a nice beach that will have people renting chairs/tents/selling drinks etc. on the beach or just near it is fine.
* not completely isolated (would like some restaurants, bars, sodas, stuff to do)
* clean and comfortable place to stay ( i think my mom would like access to a pool and a living room space to chill out instead of just a hotel bed.)
* open to both hotels and bnbs* 

on another note, i want to go fishing with my dad and would love some recommendations for a good local charter, same with some surf lesson instructors in the area!

thanks!",1,217

Ubers in La Fortuna?,"hey all,

we're coming to la_fortuna in june, but our airbnb is about 6 miles away from the main drag. i'm not sure that i want to rent a car, as i think i'd like to save a little money (also don't feel great about driving on such little sleep on unfamiliar terrain). 

as such, i'm wondering if you think it would be feasible to get by with ubers from our airbnb and utilizing this [shuttle service](https://www.easyhop.co/rutas/la-fortuna-en) to get by in town.

Some advice on sim cards!,"whatever you do, do not buy a local simcard at the claro stand where you collect your bags in sjo airport. these guys are a fraud. 
-  they only accept cash and do not give change
- they cannot give a receipt
- they offer the claro‚Äôs most expensive pre paid card as the ‚Äòcheapest‚Äô pre paid plan they have (we learned afterwards)
- the simcard you receive works for a couple of hours after which it gets blocked

when we went to a claro shop in san_jose the next day they told us the sim cards were not activated and thus we paid for nothing‚Ä¶ and we needed to pay again for decent activation. we could not provide proof we had already paid for the most expensive prepaid plan‚Ä¶ since we did not receive a receipt in the airport. 

word of advice, skip the claro shop in sjo and head for a real kolbi or claro shop in the city. 

after travelling for 3 weeks in costa_rica i am 100% sure it was a scam and not a ‚Äòmistake‚Äô at the claro shop in sjo. everywhere in the country you can pay with card and get a copy of the receipt. even in the less touristy places and shops. 

presumably the claro shop employees in sjo do really sell the genuine thing and you can pay by card. but from time to time they freeload on ignorant tourists like myself and keep the money for themselves and do no registration of the pre paid plan whatsoever. 

all in all i had zero issues in costa_rica with scams or theft etc. it was a beautiful place!",1,279

Just came back! La Fortuna - Monteverde - Manuel Antonio (Anywhere.com booking),"wanted to share the excellent experiences i got to enjoy in costa_rica and having booked everything out with [anywhere.com](https://anywhere.com). they were solid on the customer service and all the travel duration, didn't have any issues (housing/transportation/activities/etc.). altogether this package (excluding flights/food/etc.) ran me about $2700 and each day included free breakfast at the hotels i was staying at. 

day 1- alajuela & sjo int'l: transport to arenal. dropoff at hotel monte real. 

day 2 - balsa river rafting (with wave expeditions). - included snacks + lunch + beer lol!

day 3 - 2 in 1 la_fortuna waterfall & volcano hike + ecotermales - only time i didn't have transportation was from ecotermales back but my tourguides from earlier in the day were awesome and dropped me off. this included snacks + dinner. 

day 4 - taxi-boat-taxi arenal to monteverde. dropoff at claro de luna.  don juan coffee, chocolate & sugar cane tour - free coffee! 

day 5 - selvatura canopy tour (ziplines) and suspension bridges - no snacks : (

day 6 - shared shuttle transfer service from monteverde to manuel antonio.  dropoff at hotel costa verde. 

day 7 - off day

day 8 -manuel antonio national park guided tour - included snacks afterwards

day 9 - private transfer service  from manuel antonio to alajuela & sjo int'l (hampton inn and suites)

day 10 - back home!

overall loved la_fortuna and manuel antonio a lot, and looking back, i could done the same things in la_fortuna instead of going to monteverde. i'd probably request more shared shuttle service vs. the two instances of private because it felt more comfortable with more people vs. being alone. maybe i would have asked for an upgraded hotel in la_fortuna. 

i ended up ubering a few times in ma because that town is mountainous. i wasn't expecting as many bugs in the hotels but i guess i shouldn't be surprised with it being the rainforest. i was disappointed in the roads because i feel like it's not talked too often on here but they are not the best, some areas there's no road at all, and it's pretty much one lanes all over the place and not easy for those with light stomachs. 

but i felt like compared to other companies, i got a lot of activities with the best bang for my buck with [anywhere.com](https://anywhere.com) and they answered 10 billion questions easily. i highly recommend [rainforest explorers](https://www.rainforestexplorers.com/) in la_fortuna and [namaste indian restaurant](https://cdn.me-qr.com/pdf/13089062.pdf) in manuel antonio. the indian food there was better than indian food in the states.

July Honeymoon - 14 Day Itinerary Help - Activity Focused,"  

hello all,

my fianc√©e and i are traveling to costa_rica for our honeymoon at the end of july and were looking for feedback on our itinerary. i was thinking of renting a car from limon to puerto viejo and keeping the car while staying in puerto viejo. for the remaining transfers, i was planning to use a shuttle.

**day 1:** flight to limon, stay the night

**day 2 - 4:** puerto viejo de talamanca (3 days)

**day 5 - 6:** tortuguero (2 days)

**day 7 ‚Äì 8:** la_fortuna (2 days)

**day 9:** arenal (1 day)

**day 10 ‚Äì 13:** monteverde (4 days)

**day 14:** flight from san_jose

do you believe that this itinerary is doable? neither my fianc√©e nor i are into drinking and would **rather stay in areas that have activities such as rafting, snorkeling, hiking, horseback riding, boat rides, wildlife tours, and other adventure-type activities.** should i reallocate the number of days in certain cities, or consider other options? i can still change my itinerary to focus on the pacific coast if that is more optimal.

i did check vamos, adobe (mytanfeet.com) & other car rentals. still waiting for a quote from wild rider. at the moment it looks like avis has the best deal for me. my amex card should cover the cdw insurance. i have read some horror stories on car rentals for costa_rica, i\`m trying to manage my expectations on the rental car. any advice or tips is greatly appreciated!

Dilemma,"hello everyone,

i'm days away from my long awaited trip to costa_rica! i'm very excited to get there but i also have a bit of a dilemma. i've been reading a lot lately about car break ins and theft. 

on my way from san_jose to my first accomodation, i plan on visiting the poas volcano for which i already bought a ticket. now, because i'm in between accomodations, i am forced to leave my suitcase in the car when i visit the volcano. obviously, it will only contain clothes and nothing of value but still, i'd prefer not to have my stuff stolen on day one. do you think i should skip the volcano? how safe is the parking lot up there?

also any tips and tricks for a solo traveler to keep his gear safe? how safe is it to leave things in the hotel room for example?

i really love photography and having my camera or sd cards full of pictures stolen would ruin my holiday completely.

-added a tamarindo shuttle (assuming for a day trip)

-best way to arrange transportation to different excursions as we‚Äôre both nervous driving in a new country let alone different states in the us
-how to book safe, fun excursions within marriott‚Äôs website or elsewhere because when we put in the date range, it still gives us excursions that aren‚Äôt available during the date range.

the idea only just came to me, and the idea is buying a small property in costa_rica. i am from a small island in the caribbean  and our dollar is stronger than the us and colones right now.

i lived in costa_rica when i was a kid for 1 year and i loved it. i have family who are costa_rican and all that fancy stuff. 

my mother is from belize but grew up in costa_rica. so idk if that'll play some sort of role  potentially purchasing a property there.

Where should we go for two nights before Nayara Springs/La Fortuna?,"hi all. as the title implies, i‚Äôm looking for suggestions for a cool but also sensible/logical place to spend two nights before heading to la_fortuna. we are flying into lir, arriving in the afternoon around 2pm, and renting a car. i really wanted to stay at nayara springs, but they did not have a room until two days after we fly in, so we have two nights to fill in prior to checking in at ns. i am not familiar with this part of cr, having only been once to nosara and nowhere else, so it‚Äôs hard for me to gauge what is possible and logical to explore for two nights without spending too much time in the car. 

we really will only have one full day (and the morning of the following day) to explore a place, so i would love to just choose one thing to do instead of trying to pack too much in. after these two nights, we‚Äôll be in la_fortuna for 5 nights, then driving to nosara for another 5 nights.

i was thinking about monteverde, and i found a very cool airbnb there, but i‚Äôm wondering if this is too ambitious. are there other places that would make more sense? i would be so grateful for your ideas‚Ä¶thank you so much for your thoughts on this!",1,224
Review of driving with a sedan,"i want to add a comment/review on driving with a sedan after our return. i had asked for advice here in the forum and hope this post will help others with their decision making. 

our route was:

san juan airport - santa teresa - monteverde - la_fortuna - manuel antonio - uvita - airport. 

we went with a sedan which was fine 90% of the time. the other 10% i must say a sedan won‚Äôt be for everyone. i have experience driving small cars in southern europe and on greek islands, which helped a lot. this means i was kind of familiar with unknown dirt roads and streets full of holes as well as how to climb steep roads full of holes or without asphalt with a weak car. nevertheless we experienced a handful of situations where i‚Äôd say i was on the edge with my driving but also where the street was close to unsuitable to go with a sedan.

would i - in hindsight - have spent 800 instead of 350 for a suv instead of a sedan? absolutely no. the price difference is ridiculous. would i spend the extra money if i want to do remote trips in cr? absolutely yes. not only for peace of mind but also because the car might not manage - but you won‚Äôt be able to know before you‚Äôre in a bad situation as you‚Äôre not familiar with the terrain. we went only to the most touristy spots and it was enough of a challenge. 

a handful of advice

1.	‚Å†if you‚Äôre only used to wide roads in great conditions you might want to use a different type of car. simply for peace of mind. you‚Äôre on holidays.
2.	‚Å†if you‚Äôre suffering from anxiety you will simply have a calmer trip with a different type of car
3.	‚Å†be humble. if you are a cocky person with a tendency to overestimate yourself and go too fast or don‚Äôt know how to drive with a lot of anticipation, you will damage or ruin your car. more than once my friend went out of the car to make sure we can pass certain parts of the track before we went. especially in the first days
4.	‚Å†google maps might not be your friend. google aims for short trips, so it will take you down difficult roads. make sure you look well at a suggested route before going. not every shortcut will be worth it.

hope that helps others in the future.

edit: we drove during dry season and had only one day of rain! in wet season or after heavy rain the steep dirt roads would have been a blocker.",1,448

Late July Honeymoon - East or West?,"hello all,

my fiancee and i are planning our honeymoon and were looking to travel to costa_rica in late july 2023 for 13 days, where we'll be flying into san_jose. i've been reading that ""west is best"" but is that true in late july as well? does it rain more there in july?

i've mainly researched the east coast and was considering traveling to puerto viejo for a few days, la_fortuna, arenal, and monteverde. i was also considering tortuguero but not sure if it's worth it. should i consider more options on the west coast instead of these locations?

both of us are into activities such as hiking tours, visiting the volcano, snorkeling, zip lining, and seeing wildlife.

considering i am traveling in late july, should i go to the east coast and visit the places i mentioned above or should i focus my trip more towards the west coast?

i'm definitely open to suggestions and recommendations! appreciate the help!",1,163

Got back from costa rica! amazing place,"just got back from costa_rica, it was an amazing experience. heres my take on the trip!
1. total stay 8 days
2. rented car from adobe rent a car, took an economy car with collision insurance for 524 usd incl taxes
3. drove to la_fortuna and stayed at arenal parasio, book through hotwire. 
4. visited la_fortuna waterfall and arenal volcano np, didnt find arenal volcano np great as we cant trek to see any volcano, the road to adjacent peninsula is bad so be careful.
5. all places accept credit cards, get a 0 international transaction fee card!
6. went to monteverde and the roads are pretty bad (potholes) and stayed at el establo resort, good place to stay with zipline and night tours
7. went to monteverde rain forest, didnt get to see much wildlife , bought tickets at entrance
8. drove to manuel antonio and stayed at parador resort
9. booked online tickets to manuel antonio np and saw almost all the wildlife , birds sloths ‚Ä¶ 
10. paid all tolls using credit card, just got 15 usd worth cash at airport

Vamos Car Rental & CC Insurance,"when looking for information on which car rental companies were hassle free and make it easy to use credit card insurance, i wasn't really able to find something clear and succinct, so i thought i'd share my relatively painless experience.
i used vamos at sjo, and had a great experience. they accept credit card insurance with a printed email saying that your credit card company has coverage in costa_rica. mastercard does have coverage (or at least mine did) and i've read somewhere that visa no longer does.
to get the emailed letter from mastercard, call 1(800)mastercard (1-800-627-8372). don't bother with the menu options and go directly to a representative. for some reason the menu navigated rental car coverage option hangs up on you right as you near the end. once on with a representative, tell them that you need an emailed letter showing that their rental car coverage is valid in costa_rica. they will ask a few questions about your trip, and email you a pdf for you to print out. i suggest printing out 2 copies: one to give to vamos and one to keep on hand if you need to file a claim. you must decline the cdw for the cc insurance to work, but you will still have to pay for the government mandated insurance.
vamos will send you a check-in email to speed the process up, where you'll be prompted to attach a copy of your driver's license, passport, and insurance coverage letter (still bring the physical copies with you). 
when you fly into sjo, someone will be waiting for you with a vamos sign to drive you to the office. they put a $2000 deposit on credit card (needs to be same one the insurance is valid for) in case of any damage. in the scenario of any damage, your card is charged but you are reimbursed by the credit card company. remember, if you are in an accident/fender bender, do not move the vehicle until the police have showed up and cleared you to do so, otherwise your coverage is void. 
all the personelle at vamos were very nice and helpful. they didn't try to upsell anything and even made sure that the price i was paying was exactly what was quoted online, so there were no surprises. i also found that they had pretty competitive prices, particularly for 4 wheel drive vehicles, which i would highly recommend in costa_rica.
i hope this helpful for anyone traveling to this amazing place.",1,420

8 nights in Santa Teresa & Uvita/Dominical/Manuel Antonio area- need advice,"i am planning an 8 night trip at the end of may, and looking for advice as well as any must eat, drink, or chill locations! i‚Äôm traveling with my husband, 5 months pregnant & we are looking to relax, chill on the beach and be in nature (waterfalls, rainforest, animals, etc). we have been before and explore la_fortuna, monteverde, tamarindo & surrounding beaches. looking to switch it up. 

- we land at 10am in sjo and plan to rent a car and want to head towards manuel antonio. exploring the park sounds wonderful, and research was telling me that uvita or dominical are quieter and fun to explore with prettier beaches & nearby waterfalls. would you recommend staying in one location out of the three locations over the other? i‚Äôm leaning towards uvita. 

- we then want to make our way to santa teresa. is driving to jaco then taking the ferry over the best route? should we consider flying? any suggestions on the route, and good locations to hang in santa teresa are much appreciated!

Hey travel fans! I built an AI trip planner because I hate doing it (Feedback Please),"i wanted [gptmyday](https://www.gptmyday.com) to be the easiest way for ai to plan my day (still got a long way to go but hey gotta start somewhere right).

pain points:

- time-consuming: planning a detailed itinerary for a trip can take hours or even days.

-overwhelming: the amount of information available online can be overwhelming, making it challenging to sift through and extract the relevant details.

- lack of personalization: existing solutions often provide generic recommendations that may not take into account personal preferences and interests.

- uncertain reliability: user-generated content such as reviews and ratings may be biased or unreliable, leading to poor decision-making.

interests:

- personalization: i wanted trip planning solutions that can provide customized recommendations based on my interests and preferences.

- convenience: i wanted solutions that are easy to use and save my most important asset, time.

- cost-effective: finding good deals and discounts should be a priority.

- trustworthy: i wanted solutions that are reliable and provide trustworthy recommendations.

feedback (so far):

- many users are frustrated with the lack of personalization in existing trip planning solutions.

- users want a solution that can help them save time when planning their next trip and/or day.

- some users suggest that existing solutions are too focused on the most popular destinations and activities, leaving out lesser-known gems.",1,220

Only three days in CR and we're on a budget!,"hello

i'm currently traveling latin america and next month will be arriving in costa_rica. my friend will be joining me but won't be there for very long. 

they fly in on saturday morning and fly out tuesday afternoon. san_jose on both occasions

i currently have an airbnb booked for the duration in san_jose and was thinking to check out the city the first day and then maybe do two day trips from the city on the sunday and monday. however i'm not sure if that's the best idea and if we should just forget staying in san_jose altogether and travel someplace for three nights and then return

i'm not really wanting days packed full of things and money is a concern as i'm usually a fairly shoestring kinda traveller. of course this being cr i know i can expect to spend more than elsewhere but i'm not prepared to pay hundreds of dollars a day!

my friend mentioned they are interested in a coffee or chocolate tour, a national park and maybe tortuga island. personally not fussed about tortuga island. i guess wildlife and nature are what we want most, a bit of culture and some cheap food.

any suggestions would be most helpful!

many thanks in advance....",1,212

18 days in Costa Rica,"hi everyone, first time poster here! i'm going to cr in september for 18 days. this is potentially a solo trip (32f) but a friend (30f) may join at some point. my plan so far is:

3 nights in san_jose (i arrive in the evening so at least 1 night makes sense)
7 nights in la_fortuna
4 nights in nosara
3 nights in jaco (i'm really not feeling happy about this decision - can someone recommend something else?)
1 night in san_jose (before i fly home)

i am really into doing activities/sight seeing, so i'm hoping a week in la_fortuna will allow me to do everything i want to there! 

i'd really like to go to isla tortuga at some point - is there a good place to stay to do a day trip? or are any of my current destinations near enough for this?

the order of where i go is completely flexible, but i am hoping my last few days will be chilled. i'm planning on staying in hostels for the majority, but would like something a *little* more private for my last few days.

any advice appreciated!",1,194
Leaving items on the beach by chairs,"my wife and i are traveling to manuel antonio in a few weeks. we'll be there a little over a week and plan to spend a lot of time enjoying the beach. it'll be just us two. edit: the beaches near ma, such as espadilla beach.

part of enjoying the beach, to us, is sitting back and reading for a while, then going into the ocean, back to reading, etc. obviously we can't take our things (book/ereader, keys, glasses, possibly cash) with us to the water, we'd leave them with our chairs - but we don't want anything to get stolen (we're especially concerned about the wildlife, as we've read about monkeys stealing items).

has anyone else dealt with this issue? is there a strategy or item that can help, or do we just have to commit to only one person going to the water at a time? my wife seems to think there's some kind of ""lockbox"" we can get that can lock to chairs, but i don't know about that.",1,172
Where else besides La Fortuna?,"
hi! flights are booked for san_jose in mid august for 8 nights.  will be traveling with two kids (11 and 12), wife, and active 70 year old mother.  

plan on renting a car and booking first 3/4 nights in fortuna.  my question is where should we spend the remaining half?

i know monteverde is an option, but feel like it‚Äôs similar to the activities in la_fortuna.  

the other popular option is miguel antonio.  i visited cr roughly 20 years and visited miguel antonio.  i enjoyed it, but it wasn‚Äôt a highlight of the trip.  

my family lives near the beach, so beach isn‚Äôt mandatory.  the primary focus would be wildlife and jungle.

Trip Recap/Thanks for the Tips!,"we recently finished a 7 day trip to costa_rica for our 10 year wedding anniversary.  this group was instrumental in the planning/decision making and i wanted to give back by sharing our experience.  we hear people say ‚Äútrip of a lifetime‚Äù this is what they are talking about!

day 1 - landed in liberia, rented car from sixt (yes they aggressively pushed insurance) and drove to arenal.  the drive was very easy outside of very curvy roads.  you do not need a 4x4 for this area, although we did get one. because we arrived around 5pm we checked into amor arenal and relaxed there for the night. speaking of amor arenal‚Ä¶ holy smokes that resort is amazing. the villas are super private (don‚Äôt put on clothes private), views are insane from your room, and the pillows‚Ä¶ i looked them up they are so great, $250 a piece!!!  the restaurant was nice although we only ate there a few times.  they also have hiking onsite with guides included and you can see many animals. only mild complaint is the swim up bar is more like a swim up hot tub bar, prepare to sweat. 

day 2 - guided hike through to mistico hanging bridges.  if you want to see the wildlife you need a guide.  most of what you are looking at is far away and your guide has a powerful scope to look through. they also use the scope to take great pictures with your phone.  we saw howler monkeys, spider monkeys, sloths, lizards, frogs, tarantula, bats, toucans, neon cockroach, among other things!  this hike was a highlight of our trip.  we ate lunch at el novillo del arenal and it was fresh and the ambiance was nice. after lunch we hit up tabacon for the hot springs. super cool spot to relax in many different hot spring pools.  had a few drinks and hung out for a few hours. worth the day pass in my opinion.  

day 3 - started the day with breakfast at red frog coffee roasters. coffee was amazing as was the breakfast burrito. next we went on a guided hike at the bogarin trail.  if you want to see sloths go here.  there are more than 30 and it is very close to downtown la_fortuna. there is also tons of other wildlife here and it is a very easy hike. i wore sandals.  after this we hit up the la_fortuna waterfall. the hike out is no joke, but worth it.  great place for cool pics and a cold dip in the water. we ended the day in the plunge pool at our villa.  

day 4 - room service for breakfast and we were off on a 4hr drive to las catalinas. this drive was also all main roads and very easy.  we checked into casa chameleon and again we‚Äôre blown away by how nice it was.  the food here was amazing and we ate on resort for most of our meals for that reason.  one note about staying here. it is a developing community, meaning construction‚Ä¶ loud construction at times. ask the desk for a room away from it all. after settling in we took a golf cart ride to town (the hotel offers this service 24hrs per day) and did some shopping and had drinks at the brew house.  we ended the day at the resort bar to watch the sunset‚Ä¶ nothing like it that i have witnessed in my 41 years‚Ä¶

day 5 - easy morning at playa flamingo beach. we had apps and a drink at coco loco.  this beach felt very touristy to me with ppl trying to sell you stuff etc.  we ended up going to dante beach which felt much more private.  ended the day again watching the sunset at the resort bar.  

day 6 - a day of fishing that started strong with 5 tuna in the first 2 hours, but nothing after that other than a monster snapper that broke the line at the boat haha. still great to be out on the water for the day. we ended the day in the plunge pool at our villa to watch that beautiful sunset one last time.   

day 7 - we had to say goodbye‚Ä¶ slept in for the first time on the trip and had brunch before heading back to reality.  

trip of a lifetime, indeed.",1,732

Weather here end of may? Honeymoon,"hi there,

first time traveling to cr. we have a wedding in may and are immediately traveling to costa_rica after. we‚Äôll be here 9 days. 

we were able to borrow from my parents time share to stay at occidental papagayo all inclusive report (in playa hermosa guanacaste).

we‚Äôll travel to monteverde for one day and other be mainly around the guanacaste province. 

i have a bad feeling that our excursion plans will be called off / not fun due to rainy weather. i did some research beforehand obviously and may is supposed to the the start of rainy weather. 

we don‚Äôt have a ton of flexibility on when to travel here, as this is a honeymoon trip. obviously december/jan would have been ideal.

Shuttle versus car rental?,"hello allüëãüèº
we‚Äôll be flying to cr next week w our service dogs and plan to be there for the next few months! i know car rentals are a common topic, so i appreciate any tips in advance!!

we‚Äôre flying into sjo then will be staying just outside of la_fortuna for the first month. we do currently have a car rental booked for the full 34 days (from sjo) but i knowwwww that they‚Äôll hit me with another couple thousand $$ for cdw/insurance at the counter so we‚Äôre probs going to cancel.. 

not too familiar w shuttles, but they sound super reliable from what we‚Äôve researched, and possibly even cheaper? 

there are 2 of us with 2 dogs, and we‚Äôre thinking about taking a private shuttle from sjo to la_fortuna then renting a car for maybe the first week. then rely on shuttles until the last week, and rent a car again for the move over to coco (drop off car at lir). 

would this be feasible? thanks so much ia for any advice~",1,176
Google Maps,"i know everyone here loves waze and probably for good reason. we just returned from costa_rica and had no issues with google maps.

I think I only have time for either Mistico Hanging Bridges or Arenal Volcano National Park. Which would you choose?,"so i was hoping to get more done in arenal/la_fortuna, but my one day there just got shortened because i didn‚Äôt realize that driving at night is a bad idea.
here‚Äôs my plan so far: 
7am leaving from san ramon
8:45-9:15am stop at la_fortuna waterfall
10am-12:30pm mistico guided hanging bridges tour
12:30-1pm lunch
1:15-4:15pm tabacon hot springs

(maybe shorter, unguided hanging bridge walk and less tabacon time?). thanks for any advice!!!

there‚Äôs a chance we get a cheap room and stay in arenal and experience tabacon longer, in which case we‚Äôll do the park in the afternoon, but that means leaving from there at 5am the next morning for another tour we‚Äôre taking.  i imagine the roads aren‚Äôt great then either.",1,181
14-16 day Costa Rica honeymoon trip - early planning stages. Input appreciated!,"apologies if this is long winded. my fianc√© and i are in the very early stages of planning a february or march 2024 honeymoon. we want beach and forest/park time. thoughts are to see arenal volcano area and around la_fortuna, pacific coast beach and corcovado. 

we do not plan to rent a car and will rely on references for private drivers. how far in advance is ideal?

here‚Äôs a list of ideas. 

we are both wildlife enthusiasts and comes highly recommended by a co-worker, so corcovado is a must-do. more than likely we will fly from san_jose to puerto jimenez and stay for 4-5 days on the peninsula. any insight into hiring a guide for a multi day trip into the park? we are both avid hikers and have no problem getting muddy and hiking long days. 

is it worth it to go from puerto jimenez to drake (via boat from sierpe) for access to cano island for snorkeling?

cloud forest for zip lining, bridge crossings, waterfalls, rafting, etc. - monteverde, la_fortuna or ? 

thoughts on hotels/resorts to stay near arenal? nothing too pricey. the honeymoon suite splurge will likely be on the osa. 

best pacific coast beaches and hotels/airbnb? we‚Äôre into the less traveled but with nearby amenities and prefer to stay within walking distance. 

there‚Äôs so much great info on this sub from all of you. looking forward to your responses!",1,236

Tour package for solo traveller - Ecoterra?,"hi there! i'll be travelling to costa_rica for the first time in a month, i'll be travelling solo, mid-thirties male. i decided that i would look to see what packages were available from companies with plenty of good reviews on tripadvisor, i soon found the perfect tour package for me. it's a tour offered by ecoterra costa_rica, a six night package going to la_fortuna, monteverde, and jaco.   
now, for the last week i have been starting to doubt wanting to book through ecoterra, i've been trying to confirm if they do allow solo travellers and i can't get a reply. 

i e-mailed a week ago, attempted to request more information online, and on thursday i sent a message over what's app. no reply at all. 

what i'd love to know is; is ecoterra a good company? if so, i'm willing to keep trying to reach someone there. if i should move on, what's another tour company you'd recommend? i'll be travelling the week of may 21.

"1 week, December 15 2023, first time visiting","we usually try to travel in early june every year (a few weeks for an actual trip where we usually hop from one location to another every other day) and take a week off in december to relax before christmas time. that week has always been spent in an typical all inclusive resort in the caribbean (we fly out of montreal, canada) as it used to be an affordable option.

i'm getting tired of the formula and prices have gone up to point where i question if it makes any sense anymore. i was wondering if it would make sense to instead spend that money on a week in costa_rica for a 'regular' trip, exploring around an established location. cr has always been on our bucket list and i understand a week isn't much but we are locked in with these dates due to my wife's work schedule (teacher!).

would there be a preferred area that would be nice to explore for roughly a week ? looking at the obvious fauna/flora related sites, enjoying some hiking/photography and relaxing at the end of the day in a natural environment. not looking for luxury accommodation or fancy beaches, lodges could be interesting if some are actually nice versus major tourist gimmicks. something akin to this minus the bunk beds :) [https://www.booking.com/share-t3frf80](https://www.booking.com/share-t3frf80).  would car rental be a must or are day trips doable from a more 'central' location ?

thanks!

Llanos de Cortez Waterfall scam,"ok, scam may be a little harsh and click-baity. but i do want people to see this and we just had a less than desirable experience while visiting this beautiful waterfall un guanacaste.

when we took the right turn off of the highway, a young man walked out to the side of the road and asked us if we knew about the second, better, entrance to the waterfall. he said the second entrance allowed you to see 2 waterfalls and a second vantage point. he had a small map with the route and said it's an additional 5 minutes to get to the parking lot. he said the parking lot is monitored and the attendant accepts donations.

i said that sounded cool and followed his instructions. the road quickly became unpaved (not uncommon in cr) and very rocky and bumpy. it was probably the worst road we drove on the entire trip. it also took us closer to 20 extra minutes with a lot of doubt settling in before we made it to the grass lot. once there, we were immediately told it's a donation per person. not too aggressive, but not the best thing to hear after the unanticipated, offroading adventure.

then 2 young men led us through what honestly would have been a fun hike, had we been expecting it. we had 2 elderly folks with us and the local ""guides"" assured us it was a short, easy walk to the falls. it wasn't and we basically had to hand-hold our older family members through most of the trail.

once we made it to the first fall, and after hearing a bit of a sob story from on the guides about how he was struggling to go to school and take care of his mom, i quickly realized i'd been had.

the first waterfall was more of a swimming and jumping hole. it was pretty cool, but not worth the trek for our group. we then continued on to the actual waterfall and it was amazing.  but once there, we saw we could have taken the main entrance and easily walked to the ""secret"" spot. also, the second vantage point the original young man mentioned would have been a steep incline hike, so we refused to go with our older family members. 

the 2 young men that accompanied is stayed and kind of lingered until we were done viewing the waterfall.  then they walked back with us and we struggled with our older family members. once back to the parking lot, they propositioned again for more money after we had already paid upon arrival. i refused and left.

in hindsight, this was entirely my fault and i honestly am not mad about donating some money to locals. i should have noticed the original young man was just hanging out under a tree as we turned off the highway. there was no booth or anything to indicate he was official. i was fooled by a vest and a clipboard.

what bothered me was they lied about the road to get there and the difficulty of the hike when we specifically stated the reason for our concern.

oh well, live and learn. pura vida",1,534

Itinerary Feedback: 5 nights/4 full days in La Fortuna,"my wife and i (47 & 50yo) will be going to la_fortuna/arenal for 5 nights/4 full days in early may.  based on reading a lot of info here, mytanfeet, and other sources i'm thinking of the following itinerary for us, but wanted to get any feedback people might offer.  i've only booked flights, car, and hotel so far, no reservations for activities or eating yet.  not sure if we're duplicating too much and should try to add some slightly different experiences like kayaking, horseback riding, or a river tour, e.g.?  we're pretty active and would enjoy active experiences (i zero'd in on canyoning as an exciting thing to do - my wife is slightly hesitant but willing to do it), but also don't want to exhaust ourselves and want to have some time to relax or randomly explore, too.  but i'm also not sure how long some of these things may take - we don't want to waste our time, either.

9 day travel itinerary...thoughts?,"we are a family of 3 ( husband, wife and kiddo 9yr old) and planning to visit costa_rica at end of june/early july this year. right now our plan is to fly in and out of liberia airport and rent the car for our whole trip. 

we want to split our days between two locations, nature/wild life and beach town. so we are thinking la_fortuna/arenal area and either samara or tamarindo ( need input on picking one). 

&#x200b;

\- i know its hard to predict weather but we are anticipating most certainly rain every day but not torrential rain for the whole day. is that right? i think we can plan our activities around the rain as long as it rains for small part of the day.

\- is 2.5 days ( 3 nights ) enough to spend in la_fortuna? we are hoping to cover some nice hike/trails, waterfall, zip lining, other wild life activities in that neighborhood. should we give this more time and spend 3 full days?

\- for la_fortuna stay, we will most likely to go with the hotel accommodation. any good recommendation that is central to all the activities and good with amenities? 

\- we are hoping the beach town part of our stay is more chill / relaxing. we are a family that loves to eat and try tasty local restaurants / market / food spots. we will definitely be spending time at the beach (and/or pool) everyday if possible but we also want to mix up with light activity every day in the near by area. i heard tamarindo is more bustling and crowded than samara which is more chill / laid back. right now i am leaning towards samara but my main concern is if we will run out of things to do since we are spending full 5 days ( 6 nights ). i think we can do a day trip to nosara one of the day. i wanted to hear from the people here if there are enough things to do in samara or near by area and plenty restaurant options without getting repetitive or being bored. 

\- for the beach town stay we are leaning towards airbnb. i have seen some good ones with nice pool / hot tub, amenities and some with even nicer views. we tend to feel claustrophobic in hotel rooms when we stay for more than few days. 

\- in terms of travel route, thinking liberia->la_fortuna->samara/tamarindo->liberia. as oppose to doing beach town first then la_fortuna in second half. i dont know if one is really better than the other but wanted to know if people here had strong opinion on it.

i wanted to know if folks here had any opinion/suggestion on all or any of the things posted above. we are excited about coming to costa_rica and wanted to find out if this travel itinerary is doable without being overwhelming. 

please chime in. thank you in advance!",1,499

Almost there...,"hello everyone üëã

m/37/solo trip

i'm going to be arriving in the beginning of may in san_jose for a 23 day holiday in costa_rica. my goal is to see and photograph as much rainforest and wildlife as possible along with waterfalls and volcanoes. here is the latest draft of my plan:

day 1 - arrive into san_jose 17:00ish. check in hotel near airport, go to nearby mall and buy a sim card for internet on the go

day 2 - go pick up rental car from jumbo and make my way to the poas volcano. ticket booked already for 13:30. leave and if still have time visit the la paz waterfalls on my way to the second destination, recreo verde. if not enough daylight left, come back next day. check in at recreo verde

day 3 - explore the area, pozo azul, catarata del toro and that general area

day 4 - explore the area / mariposario alas/bosque alegre

day 5 - drive to la_fortuna. check in at hotel in la_fortuna, explore a bit around town

day 6 - arenal national park / hot springs (any suggestions for cheaper alternatives to tabacon?)

day 7 - hanging bridges / fortuna waterfall with hike to chato volcano

day 8 - drive to rio celeste / volc√°n tenorio national park. check in to hotel. explore surroundings.

day 9 - rio celeste and hike to laguna azul / check out some other jungle treks

day 10 - explore the area some more. this is the area i know least about probably so if you know anything nice to do in the region, i'd appreciate some suggestions.

day 11 - wake up early and drive to manuel antonio national park. stop at crocodile üêä bridge. check in to hotel

day 12 - explore the hotel grounds and at 11:20 i have booked my first ticket into the national park. explore park.

day 13 - rise early as i have booked another day in the national park this time i found the earliest ticket so i'll be in the first group at 7. explore park until famished.

day 14 - leave manuel antonio for the osa peninsula. drive early to make sure i reach finca sue√±o de osa during the day. road tricky, suzuki jimny go brrrr. 

day 15 - hike jungle on outskirts of corcovado national park alone, avoid becoming üêÜ poop. 

day 16 - do a morning hike and then leave for drake bay area. after short and hopefully uneventful ride reach db and check in. explore new surroundings.

day 17 - do drake bay free trail 

day 18 - day trip to corcovado / sirena station

day 19 - no idea, jungle
 
day 20 - maybe a trip to an island 

day 21 - leave drake bay early and drive to hacienda mil bellezas where i will enjoy my day and relax 

day 22 - wake up early and enjoy the grounds.drive to hotel near airport in the afternoon.

day 23 - wake up and go return car to jumbo with not a scratch on it. return to hotel, leave luggage a bit and wonder around the mall. make my way to the airport with a ton of memories and two or three full sd cards and fly home at 19:00.

how does all of that sound to you? doable? i know it's the start of the rainy season and i probably should have done osa first but i've already paid for first two accomodations and can't switch the order anymore. my budget except for accomodation and car rental is about 90 dollars a day. is that realistic?

should i bring any cash or better withdrawal from atm? how are exchange rates for cash?

Looking for Tamarindo reviews / alternate suggestions,"i‚Äôm currently planning a week long trip to costa_rica in august, and as of right now, the plan is to fly into liberia, spend 3 full days in tamarindo and 3 full days in la_fortuna.

my group consists of 4 people, mid 20‚Äôs, all hispanic and spanish-speaking. we want to spend a few days at a beach with a busy nightlife. we definitely would like to hit up local bars and do some dancing at night. 

my concern is whether or not tamarindo is the right choice for the first half of my trip- i‚Äôve heard it has a great night life and a beautiful beach, but also that it is ‚Äútamagringo‚Äù. i think everyone in the group would prefer to be around other spanish-speakers and in more of a popular area for the locals.

La Fortuna and Monteverde in 4 nights?,"seeking some wisdom as i‚Äôm currently planning last minute **4 night 5 days** trip to costa_rica for my family.

- we are big nature fans and looking for a mix of: hiking, waterfalls, jungle exploration (wildlife/coffee or chocolate farms, etc), surfing (we are beginners that have only surfed a handful of times) and hot springs/beach relaxation. what are the must sees for these? is la_fortunate too touristy, or is it possible to enjoy it slightly off the beaten path? we are not interested in zip lining, 4 wheelers or family oriented activities.

- for beach and rainforest, we would love to spend a few nights in the jungle at an eco lodge or similar, likewise with the beach something more quaint / not party central. recommendations welcome - is tamarindo too much like cancun?

all in all, your tips for a 1-2 week itinerary for the above would be awesome! we both drive and would rent a car.

"Help with finding snorkeling, hiking and mountain biking tours + who offers the best PADI training? Playa del Coco, Playa Hermosa area.","in november this year some family and i are going to costa_rica for the first time, and i am very excited! i'm trying to find stuff to do and how to get the most bang for our buck, but i am having a hard time finding tours and such offered by locals. while we are willing to splurge on maybe 1 or 2 trips, we would rather find something more affordable or that we can do on our own and not be in a group with other people or even have to pay a tour guide. we can go at our own pace then, and not have to head back home after an hour walk. we would also like travel time to be less than 2 hours to spots. we might go further for something we really want to see, but the less time spent driving the better!

we all like nature, so i am hoping to find some decent trails that don't cost an admission fee of any kind. we would also like to hear of any locals that offer snorkeling trips. i've seen a few places offer good rates, but we would like to support locals if possible. we've done it before elsewhere and had good luck, but figured i'd ask here first and get an idea of what to expect. my brother and his girlfriend love to mountain bike as well, so to find a shop that offers rentals and let them explore around would be great!

on a side note, i want to get my padi while i am down there. i've seen rocket frog, ba divers, and one more i forget. i would like to know who offers the best padi course for open water or scuba diver. i've taken discover scuba before and definitely want to get into it more on my next trip to the tropics.

Help me decide whether or not to visit la fortuna,"hey folks! i am taking my first solo trip to cr in a few weeks. i am planning on flying into sjo and staying in a hostel downtown san_jose. i'll be in the country for 1 week.

i'm really interested in visiting a hot springs, and from my research i see that la_fortuna is well known for their hot springs.

if i'm going to travel all the way to la_fortuna, i want to make sure i have at least 2 activities planned including the hot springs because i'm not sure hot springs alone is worth 6+ hours of travel 

i'm interested in ziplining, but i acknowledge that la_fortuna is not the only place i can zipline

i'm interested in seeing the arenal volcano, but only if i can get some hiking in. i'm solo traveling, so i feel hesitant to hike alone.  i also acknowledge that there are other beautiful places to hike closer to sj

i'm open to a day trip, but i can't seem to find one where you truly get two whole activities in . a lot of the volcano+ hot spring trips reviews say they just looked at the volcano for a few minutes

i'm a little open to staying 1-2 nights in la_fortuna, but i've noticed the hostels have lower reviews than the ones in san_jose and even the selina has reviews that cite mold problems.

i see that most of the shuttles and buses travel during the day, and i haven't decided if spending long hours in a vehicle during daylight hours is the best use of my time in the country if i'll only be there for 7 days

PSA - avoid Red Lava tours,"they‚Äôre in la_fortuna and we had the worst experience with them. the tour was not at all as advertised - it was shorter, missing a lot of the elements it claimed to have and just a complete misrepresentation of the actual experience. the tour guide was also quite possibly the worst one i‚Äôve ever seen. 

it‚Äôs weird because they have good reviews online (which is why we booked them) but when we spoke to others in la_fortuna, they all said red lava tours is known for being subpar.

If you only had 4 days ‚Äî,"hey yall! if you are willing to read this and help out, i can‚Äôt thank you enough!

so my partner and i are traveling to papagayo in 4 weeks for a wedding. i have very little job flexibility, and, unfortunately, don‚Äôt learn whether my pto is approved until the schedule for that time is published. after months of crossing our fingers, almighty boss man has approved my request, and i‚Äôve got an extra four days/five nights to spend in cr!

at this point i have researched my head off and am utterly overwhelmed by how much there is to do and see in cr. partner and i both absolutely love wildlife, particularly birds, but we are going to be 100% worn out from the first half of the trip and very ready to relax.

hopefully this is just our first trip to costa_rica and, next time, we can jam-pack our itinerary with multiple stops. but for this particular stretch of days, i‚Äôm looking for a balance of creature comforts, downtime at the pool/beach, and as much wildlife exposure as possible without a full-blown trek into the forest. 

i have found a few resort properties that look great but, before i book, i was wondering if anyone here would be open to sharing any lived-experience suggestions.

a tl;dr re: what i‚Äôm looking for ‚Äî

1. distance from papagayo is the least of my concerns. if there‚Äôs something amazing nearby, the proximity is obviously a bonus, but i am used to driving in high-risk, unfamiliar environments and am undeterred by a road trip. on the other hand, i freak out on tiny planes but will board one if warranted. basically ‚Äî i care more about the destination than the journey this time around and am fully prepared to drive to manuel antonio at this point

2. nice to luxe-ish resort ($500 usd per night max) that is either beachfront or beach-adjacent. willing to go a little pricier if the beach is true paradise, or it the property is especially serene and/or wellness-oriented

3. plentiful birdwatching opportunities along with some monkeys, iguanas, and, if we‚Äôre lucky, a sloth nearby.

Car Rental Advice,"hello all,

first of all, sorry for post #6275288 about car rentals. but we are super unsure because we don't know a bit about costa_rica.

we, both male and 23 years old, want to travel to the following destinations on our three week trip:

san_jose - la_fortuna
la_fortuna - monteverde
monteverde - santa teresa
santa teresa - samara
samara - corcovado park
corcovado park - puerto viejo
(+tortuguero if possible)

not necessarily in this order and we want to stay flexible. we rather want to travel cheap and just have the best time there.

i calculated the costs per person and came to about 90‚Ç¨ if we go by bus and about 430‚Ç¨ if we rent a mitsubishi at sixt.

my first and most important question to the experienced cr connoisseurs here is: in your opinion (especially because we want to see the east and west coast) is the surcharge for the car worth it?

secondly, has anyone had experience with sixt as a car rental company?

and lastly, i would appreciate your opinion on the destinations i have listed.

thanks in advance and our excitement is huge for the trip that starts on saturday!",1,199

Help me not waste any time with my daughter!,"i just arrived in costa_rica this morning with my daughter and due to work stress and general life craziness, didn't have a ton of time before the trip to plan out activities. i'm hoping this group might be able to help me maximize our time here without wasting it.

a little about us and our trip:

its my 11 yo daughter and i on this trip. my wife and i promised her when she turned 8 that she could take a trip with 1 parent but then covid happened and we just haven't been able to make it work until now. we are pretty adventurous. we are generally not super into the normal tourist stuff. when i travel i like to find places with as few people as possible, and i like to explore. i don't mind a little extra driving, dirt/bad roads, etc. 

we are staying 3 nights in playa hermosa, near jaco. from here to go to monteverde for a night and then la_fortuna for 3 nights before heading home.

my daughter is obsessed with sloths so seeing one is a must. she also wants to snorkel (even though i've warned her that the snorkeling here might not be as good as some other places like the caribbean). other than that, the plans are pretty well wide open.

here are a few things i'm looking at:
-manuel antonio (this doesn't seem like my vibe but being able to do the beach and potentially see a sloth in the same area is enticing)
-uvita
-isla tortuga (for snorkeling)
-viento fresco waterfall
-rio celeste
-cloud forest
-arenal lake and volcano
-possibly a zip line (for her)
-would love to do a night frog tour

i would appreciate any suggestions this group might have on what is worth it, what isn't, what other ideas might fit our style, any off the beaten path kind of stuff we could do on our own (i'm generally not a fan of guided tours).

thanks!",1,332
Some lessons from my first trip,"lesson 1: when you deal with costarican roads, measure the trip in minutes, not in kilometers. our canadian brains thought that 8km detour to a nice-view restaurant is going to be a brisk, but it turned out to be an hour-long adventure with the first shock from narrow roads, single-lane bridges and climbing at a seemingly 45-degree angles.

lesson 2: mobile connection is important. offline google maps routinely failed us, leading to road closures, wrong direction on one-way streets and to pedestrian bridges. waze is much better in costa_rica but make sure that you do not switch your navigation off while offline, like we got, when ended up nonplussed in front of a mountain road construction, with phones offline.

lesson 3: mobile connection is important (again). get a good plan asap, before driving anywhere. we've got kolbi sim cards from car rental, but did not figure out how to add new funds and wasted our initial credit within half a day. claro has more transparent (and cheaper) plans, - $10 plan covered us for the whole 10 days.

lesson 4: get all-wheel drive car, and if you are not alone - get a bigger car. we've initially got mitsubishi asx, and although we were able to fit, it was just barely. upgrading to hyundai tucson was a good decision - as soon as we added food and water bottles (and souvenirs, and wet towels, and swimsuits, and slippers) - the trunk filled up again.",1,245

US Embassy Info Re: Malaria,"since there have been posts and questions about the malaria outbreak on the caribbean side of costa_rica, i thought i‚Äôd pass along this info from the us embassy:

health alert: u.s. embassy, san_jose (april 13, 2023)

 location: countrywide 

 event:  there have been reports of an increase in the number of malaria cases in costa_rica. though these cases have been reported primarily in the caribbean province of limon, there is an increased risk anywhere in costa_rican, especially in coastal or low-lying zones.

 malaria is a  mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite.  severe malaria can cause serious health problems and even death.  if you experience any symptoms including a fever, while traveling or after you return to the united states, see a doctor or nurse.

 actions to take:‚Äã 

¬∑        visit cdc‚Äôs website on malaria.

¬∑        if you travel to an area where malaria is common, taking medicine can help keep you from getting it. if you plan to travel in costa_rica, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.

¬∑        if you are pregnant and traveling in an area with malaria, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.  you may have a higher risk of getting malaria than other people, and you could get much sicker.

¬∑        other precautions:

o   stay inside at night ‚Äì this means any time after sunset and before sunrise.

o   wear shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when you go outside.

o   wear bug spray or cream that contains deet or a chemical called picaridin.

o   sleep in a building with good screens over the windows and doors or air conditioning.  or, you can sleep under a bed net treated with bug spray.

Help w/ last minute itinerary,"hi all, i‚Äôm visiting cr for 2 weeks (here right now) and am debating whether to spend my second week (6 days) in manuel antonio, puerto viejo, or in the osa peninsula, and would love some advice. i‚Äôm a 30(f) solo traveler and this is my first time in cr. unfortunately, i don‚Äôt speak spanish. so far i‚Äôve been to s√°mara, monteverde (which i loved), and am currently at an ecolodge near la_fortuna. im heading to la_fortuna tomorrow and only planning to spend 1 night but could extend. 

i was originally drawn to the osa peninsula because of its biodiversity reputation (i work in international conservation), but the distance is putting me off, plus the cost. also, i did some hiking in monteverde, so i‚Äôm inclined to choose somewhere i can relax for a bit before heading home and was hoping to be in a social environment. caribbean is appealing but maybe not with the malaria outbreak. 

im leaning towards manuel antonio, but is 6 days too much? i only have 1 night booked in lf but could stay another if there‚Äôs a lot to see and then have 5 days in ma. 

thanks so much for any insights üôè",1,202
Feedback on 5 week stay,"haven‚Äôt been to costa_rica before. taking our 8 kids (ages 10 months - 16) for 5 weeks in june/july. 

any advice/feedback welcome. 

the idea we had was to stay a week ‚Äúhere‚Äù, a week ‚Äúthere‚Äù to experience the different areas (esp since driving can take a while). 

- 6/7 fly into sjo and stay night in san_jose at a hotel
- 6/8 - 6/19 punta uva area airbnb
- 6/19 - 6/24 fortuna or monteverde airbnb (ideally a treehouse vibe)
- 6/24 - 6/30 somewhere near tamarindo in guanacaste - airbnb
- 6/30 - 7/8 peninsula near tambor beach - airbnb 
- 7/8 - 7/12 airbnb near jaco
- 7/12 - 7/13 hotel in san_jose and then fly out

trying to stay at all beachfront properties (except monteverde/fortuna).

plan to rent a 12 passenger van (manual) from toyota.


thoughts?


specific questions:
- do we need a/c this time of year?
- are there other options besides airbnb that we should be exploring?
- how much would it cost for someone to make us meals for a week?
- should we be concerned about crocodiles on beaches?
- are we crazy?",1,193

Protecting Belongings While On Foot or at The Beach?,"so i‚Äôll be traveling solo in may, have a few questions and could use the help.

also, it seems if i want to take a swim in the ocean, i cannot just sit my belongings (phone/cash) on my towel on the beach unattended, which means i‚Äôll need a waterproof waist pack. any recommendations on a good one?

Renting a car versus shuttles/taxi/uber?,"i've done a ton of research into whether to rent a car or not and was all set on going the shuttle route with taxis/uber as needed because it seemed significantly cheaper, but i realized that i don't know how much taxis/ubers will cost me so now i'm wondering if the shuttle/taxi route is still significantly more economical than renting. i'm traveling solo so i'm also bearing all of the costs.

i'm planning to go for 4-5 weeks (starting in late april). i'm landing in san_jose, then heading to la_fortuna, monteverde, and then somewhere on the west coast before heading to liberia to head home.

i know it's impossible to give an exact number, but if possible, i'd love to hear what people think might be some reasonable price ranges for how much i might spend over four weeks on ubers/taxis (or even on a per day or per trip basis if that's easier to calculate), and how much of a difference it makes if i'm in the city versus staying somewhere 10-20 minutes outside of the city.

&#x200b;

**option 1: renting a car = $1800**

this is through adobe, 4x4 for four weeks, includes insurance.

&#x200b;

**option 2: shuttle (\~$280) + taxi/uber (???)**

interbus prices seem to be around $70 between any of these destinations. with my current itinerary, i'd need four bus tickets then for a total of $280.

but where it gets tricky is i don't know how much i'd be spending on transportation while i'm in each of these areas. i don't have any lodging booked yet, and i will probably look for a mix between being in the city areas versus being 10-20 minutes outside of the city centers.

"I could use some advice on my upcoming 2 day trip in San Jose, Tortuga Island, and maybe Arenal??","i‚Äôm so excited to visit costa_rica in a couple weeks but really need some advice on what to do!  my girl and i are flying into san jos√© late on a friday night and she‚Äôs flying home monday morning so we only have 2 full days there together (i‚Äôm staying for a couple days solo).  she wants to see tortuga island and a volcano.  

i was thinking of renting a car, but it looks like there are good bus tours to tortuga island from san_jose.  suggestions?  does anybody have a recommendation for their favorite?  am i better off driving for any reason?

if we drive i was thinking we‚Äôd drive halfway to arenal at night and finish the rest of the drive in the morning.  any suggestions on arenal tours?  maybe atvs?  a friend was telling me that tabacon is magical, and i‚Äôve heard great things about the springs.  i‚Äôm thinking this could be a good place to spend the second half of the day.  then drive back to san_jose to sleep there and wake up in the morning to get her to the airport.

is this too much?  is it crazy?  should we just take a bus trip to tortuga island and back one day and then a bus trip to a different volcano and back the next day? po√°s volcano?

Itinerary Timing Question!,"hey all! about to head out for a planned trip to costa_rica which we are very excited about. just wanted to ask about one portion of our itinerary and the feasibility of it. our last day in country is april 21st 2023 wherein we will be in la_fortuna. our departure flight is that exact same date at around 5pm in the evening out of the liberia airport. based on that, we are suppose to be at the airport for 2pm. as far as i understand, the drive time from la_fortuna to liberia is about 3 hours. with that in mind, our plan is to leave la_fortuna with our rental car at 8am leaving us 6 hours to get to the liberia airport. i know that seems very early but we obviously want to ensure that we have more then enough time to get there (including any unforeseen delays which will likely happen on the road) and drop off our rental at the airport with ample time to check in and make our flight. just wanted to ask how feasible this is and if leaving the day if our departure from la_fortuna to liberia is an okay plan or if we should consider an alternate. i know it‚Äôs not the greatest of plans as it leaves some room for things to go wrong however i just wanted to get everyone‚Äôs thoughts on if its realistic and something we actually could/should do. thanks ahead of time!",1,249

Help our animal sanctuary raise money for a new vehicle!,"[https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-raise-money-for-a-new-sanctuary-vehicle](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-raise-money-for-a-new-sanctuary-vehicle)

alturas wildlife sanctuary is a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and releasing costa_rican wildlife. we need your help reaching our goal of $28,000 for a new 4x4 vehicle for wildlife rescues, education outreach, research and volunteer & intern related-activities.

our sanctuary lies in one of the world's most densely populated wildlife regions. costa_rica holds more than 5% of the world's plant and animal species, making it one of the most bio-diverse countries in the world. between 2014-2022 our 24/7 emergency clinic rescued 2,568 sick, injured, and orphaned wildlife. many animals entering alturas have been domesticated, abused, or have suffered disabilities due to human interaction. in the case that they can't be released, we provide them with a safe refuge to live out the rest of their lives. 100% of our funding is raised through our volunteer program, tours, and donations, all of which goes directly back to ensuring the good health and safety of the animals in our care.

with the number of animals we take in weekly, it is of the utmost importance that we have a reliable vehicle on sight. unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, we only have one car available for rescues and releases to conduct purchases for the animals such as medications, educational seminars, volunteer activities, and research. this infringes on our ability to properly rescue wildlife promptly and efficiently, coordinate reliable days and times for our community outreach program, and give our volunteers and interns an authentic costa_rican experience.

reliable vehicles are costly here in costa_rica, making it difficult for a non-profit like ourselves to raise the money for a new car. for this reason, we are asking for your help to raise funds so we can continue our mission of rescuing, rehabilitating, and releasing local wildlife and educating our community on the importance of preserving our ecosystems.

i like the idea of going south to the osa peninsula to get a true jungle experience and maybe do 1-2 nights in corcovado. with 10 days maybe i can do osa for several and still see arenal as well.

or since it‚Äôs my first visit would i be better off just going the usual tourist routes that a mentioned in the first part of this post? just looking for some suggestions!",1,123

Help Wanted: Manuel Antonio Advice,"we are taking my mom to manuel antonio next week. she is battling stage 4 metastatic cancer, but feels good enough to travel and enjoy life to the fullest.  

we have a rental car (4x4) booked for the entire time.

* we have booked a private nature tour of ma, night hike, and have a few others in mind already, just looking for more suggestions.*

she really wants to go to the hot springs 45 mins outside of ma. should we book a tour or can we drive to them and pay at the entrance?
 
what are your favorite places to eat? i personally love experiencing the local cuisine, but my dad would probably like to do some touristy places too. we already have el avion on the list, what else?

what are your favorite beach locations? are any of them particularly steep to get to in terms of walking? mom‚Äôs balance isn‚Äôt the best since she‚Äôs gone through chemo.

Should We Visit?,"hi there, we are looking for a nice beach destination to visit for my daughter's hs grad trip this summer. we have never been to costa_rica and would love to experience the beauty and wildlife there. adventurous family of 4 who want to snorkel, hike, hoping for warm ocean and lush green tropical forests, rivers, waterfalls. my question is in june and july is it safe to swim in the ocean? my kids are like fish and they are good swimmers, but did not grow up near the ocean. in my research, it's sounding like there are a lot of dangerous currents and riptides on both sides of the coast and no lifeguards. this has really deterred us as i would be worried the whole time. also, we are not really resort people and would like to be able to venture out on our own and explore places. did this feel like a safe option in costa_rica? are there certain beaches/areas that are best? are there other similar places with warm ocean we should consider instead?",1,178

Just back from 15 days in Costa Rica.

showed my credit card insurance for to them at check in and the c/d insurance was removed. only paid $551.00 for a 2 week rental. i assumed they would try to charge me e yea when i got the car back but nope. everything worked perfectly. they spoke good english and it was a super easy transaction. i would highly recommend them and will use again.",1,152
"Companies providing half day snorkeling trips in Nicoya, late April","my partner and i are planning a last minute trip to cr at the end of this month. we plan on spending 3 days in arenal and monteverde, followed by 3 days on the coast. we are planning on beach(s) in nicoya, but are flexible. we will have rental car.

a big priority for us is snorkeling trips. we have had a hard time researching this topic both because a lot of company's only offer private trips (which are not economic as there are only 2 of us), and also a lot of companies websites are sparse on details.

specifically, we are trying to find trips that maximize our time on the water. ideally it would be something like a half day of snorkeling, rather than a trip that packages snorkeling with sailing/booze cruise/island visit. we are also wary of trips that are scuba-focused, that might take us to locations were it's too deep to get the most out of snorkeling.

ultimately, we plan on having a great time doing whatever is available to us, but if anyone knows of a company that offers something like this please let me know! it can be pretty much anywere in the northwest, as far south as perhaps dominical or uvita. i know the oso peninsula would be great for this, but we will have to save it for another trip due to time constraints.",1,232

Manuel Antonio tips,"hola pura vida!! (get used to that!)

staying at gaia this week in manuel antonio and beautiful. few tips i have so far:

1) we went to manuel antonio park on our own (so didn‚Äôt pay for guide). booked the 0700-0740 time slot which was perfect. first part of morning not crowded and followed the sloth trail to manuel antonio beach. unbelievably scenic and no one around. beautiful soft sand with small waves. once
left there went to gelenas beach which was maybe 10 min walk and incredibly rocky and rough but saw tons of monkeys basically putting on a show for us. unbelievable!  we stayed 4 hours and walking back seems like disney world just opened for rope drop with people streaming in everywhere.  go early!  gaia has an hourly shuttle that drops off at park but if driving ignore all the fake parking attendants. there is a huge lot right near little alley that leads to park. one last tip. if just paying for entrance without guide like we dis you can still see people crowding around the scope of a guide and can see what they are looking at or in our case they took a photo through the scope with my daughters phone of a sloth up close (attached). 

2). if you can visit rainmaker park and book the self guided tour online for $20 per person. amazing hiking trail with several jaw dropping swimming holes on second half. on our own still saw
poison dart frog and lizards. from reviews i read others with guide don‚Äôt see much more and way more expensive. 

3). obvious but if staying at resort make your way to a supermercado and stock up on beer, etc since will be way cheaper than resort probably. in ma beach area it was like 5500 for 6 pack of their local imperial beer.",1,311
6 Full Days - Are two stops feasible?,"everything i've seen indicates that longer is better, but unfortunately we have very fixed dates for when we can arrive. i'm trying to find a nice mix of seeing more of the country (if possible) without rushing or having too many of my days wasted driving between places. that probably means one, maybe two different places to visit on my trip.

here's my travel details:

1) saturday: arrive in san_jose by noon, immediately take a private shuttle to where ever my first stop is.
2) sunday - friday: 6 full days to work with
3) saturday: an early flight out of san_jose that morning. realistically, that will mean we need to get back to san_jose by the evening of friday, cutting into one of our ""free days"".

as a start, i'm fine paying for private transportation between places since that will save us time and give a little more freedom.

the jungle and nature is a a little bit more appealing to me, so i'd definitely want a stop there, but would be ok with a beach as a second stop. that leads me to think monteverde or la_fortuna should be places to visit. if i only went to one of them, would that be too long? i considered a day or two in san_jose, but that doesn't seem like a very popular choice. otherwise, there are just so many places i see recommended that i am a little overwhelmed about which to look into, which are practical, which are ""different enough"". also, this would be in august so should i leave some extra time in case of bad weather?

lots to think about, but i appreciate your help",1,284

Pavones Solo Surf Trip,"landing in golfito in a few hours and then on my way to pavones (actually, staying in pilon). 

after years of dealing with rehab from knee surgeries (i use to play soccer in college and then a men‚Äôs team) and doing the bs of starting a career i‚Äôm finally getting the opportunity to just chill and surf for a month. and i‚Äôm pumped. getting to relax and learn to surf and meet some good people along the way was like a bucket list type of thing and it‚Äôs happening now haha.  (btw i‚Äôve surfed a few times before but def a beginner.)

after speaking with a good buddy who lived in costa_rica for quite some time, pavones seemed like the right vibe. i just want to relax and minimize the ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list and the hustle that we often feel to get ‚Äúeverything‚Äù done.

surfing

- what are your favorite spots?
- what times are generally best to go?
- anyone you prefer as a guide or instructor?
- any other locations around you really liked?

general 

- where do travelers gather to meet and hang out? some favorite spots?
- getting around. looks like renting an all wheel drive car seems essential to having a good life, but is it really necessary? thoughts on cabs, renting for a day or two? hitchhiking? sharing rides? hiring a driver?
- i‚Äôm gonna be at one airbnb in pilon for 30 days. any local establishments or communities or people to absolutely meet?
- if you spent some time here too, what was your life like? what did you do day to day? (i still have to work during the days‚Ä¶)

Costa Rica‚Äôs culture of theft,"just wrapping up my second visit to cr.  this stay was for 17 days.  probably my last.  why?  i am sooo tired of the people ripping me off in front of my eyes.  i am fairly certain it happened every single day, most times multiple times per day.   examples:

- this happened as soon as i got off the plane and set the tone for the entire trip:  avis car rental.  i was well read on the insurance scam that is cr business.  i expected to pay $10-25 per day extra for 17 days.  nope. he told me $42.  ‚Äúis that the cheapest?‚Äù  yep.  ‚Äúcan you do any better?‚Äù  nope.  what am i going to do? so i rent the car.  shame on me, but when i look on the bill he charged me $50 a day.  i had already left at that point.  (i tried to book with cr companies but they were sold out).
- poncho seller at rio celeste.  sign says ¬¢1500 colones, i verify with him, ¬¢1500.  i hand him ¬¢2000.  he turns and walks away?  am i really going to argue over 500? no.
- gas station attendant.  pump says 33000.  hand me credit card machine and bill says 36000.  i point it out and he fixed it.  
- many road side food stands didn‚Äôt mark their prices, resulting in the wildly different prices 100‚Äô with food stands apart.
- pulled over by police, admits he just wants money.  i give him $5usd, he‚Äôs happy.  
- restaurant, commonly added items we didn‚Äôt order to our bill.  every place fixed it without question.  most places had a automatic 10% service charge.  probably 5 times i was handed the machine and asked would i like to leave a tip?  not ‚Äúwould you like to leave an extra tip?‚Äù  one time it was the owner who did it. 
- a $225 night airbnb host.  meets us at check in. tried to wash my hands.  when i turn the spigot, no water comes out the hot side and the cabinet has a physical lock on it with a chain and padlock.  ask, what about hot water?  she says, you can get it from shower or here is a kettle you can boil some.  advertised with ac.  no ac.  the photos in airbnb ad are all heavily edited to make the place look new when it is probably 30 years old with 30 year old furniture.  abandoned the place and will fight out the 4 nights we paid for with bnb/credit card.  ‚Äúwell equipped kitchen‚Äù means diaper wipe box of silverware, 4 bowls, 4 plates, for our family of 4.(realistically this was someone‚Äôs home that they moved out of for some extra cash).  i kind of hate complaining as this is true first world problems, but i am paying you $225/night.  we lost half a day of our trip trying to find another place easter week, very high season.
- $800/night bnb, ocean side, with pool - main toilet that served the second floor never worked despite repeated asks to repair.  frogs repeatedly came through the sewer system into the house. (watched it happen).  ice machine never worked.  missing half the roof.  thankfully it didn‚Äôt rain while we were there.  10 more issues but you get the point.  but the part that really irked me, we were ready to check out at 9, and manager insisted we stay until she comes and checks out the house.  car is packed, family is ready for our 4 hour drive.  she insists we stay until she arrives at 9:30.  she shows up at 10.  then she claims we stole 2 towels and we need to give her $40 cash.  this is against bnb policy.  i invite her to inspect my luggage as i didn‚Äôt steal her 5 year old towels.  i tell her to file complaint with bnb.  
- our group charters a $1,200/day catamaran.  which is the going rate from what i can tell.  we get there and it is a dual hull motor boat built for diving.  all fiber glass, no padded seats.  not built for cruising the ocean with your family.  probably a $100k boat instead of a $1m boat new.  go anyway.  payment time.  oh you need to pay the sales commission person too, that‚Äôs another $150.  

i could write 5 more examples, but you get the point.  our first trip to cr wasn‚Äôt as bad, but it certainly happened.  

my car, full of luggage, left in national park parking lot for 4 hours?  undisturbed.

edit:  i‚Äôve been held at a remote location in argentina till i coughed up $400 by my ‚Äúhost‚Äù.  my shuttle was not allowed to enter the property and was held at the gate to the 50k hectare ranch.  i‚Äôve been shaken down by the mexican police driving and had my rental entered by 6 mexican police at 7am because i dared to complain to the owner that power was out for 2 days (two incidents).  i‚Äôve spent 4+ months in latin america.  i‚Äôm very familiar with travel here. cr seems institutionalized theft, which seems strange when everywhere we went (santa teresa, south of tamarindo, la_fortuna, dominical) have large tourism economies.  

as to whether i enjoyed my vacation, that‚Äôs not the point of this post.  i‚Äôve had amazing vacations and i‚Äôve had ok vacations. i‚Äôve never had a bad vacation.",1,896

the prices in la_fortuna are ridiculous - i'm not sure if it's because it's easter week but things are definitely more expensive here. also, in ways that didn't happen in mv or ma, we feel like we are more often being ripped off or viewed as money bags (we're young backpackers). i've been asked if i want a massage 5 times in 4 days - i haven't been asked that elsewhere in cr. so many people recommended la_fortuna to us but we are really contemplating leaving early to go elsewhere!

Denied entry b‚Äôcas my wife‚Äôs passport did not meet the 6 months validity by 3 days.,"we were denied entry to costa_rica because my wife‚Äôs passport did not meet the 6 months of validity period by 3 days. we calculated by month and not days. we reached costa_rica on april 5 and her passport expires of october 2. 
my wife completely broke down. this was supposed to be our honey moon. last adventure before the start of a new phase of life. i think it was very brutal for the immigration officers to deny us entry. all our booking could not be cancelled because we were so close to our reservations. the immigration officers did not have any sympathy at all. i understand it‚Äôs the government rules and the immigration officers need to follow the government rules. but what disappointed me the most was the look of amusement on one of the immigration officers face seeing my wife break down. i am not sure but i felt like he was taking a video. i can‚Äôt be sure because i was distracted consoling my wife. but he was laughing at our state.
i think costa_rica is a beautiful country but i am very disappointed by the way we were treated. we were there for a vacation, our honeymoon, with hopes to create memories we could cherish for a lifetime. this is not possible now. i understand it‚Äôs our fault as well, but still very disappointed and extremely sad. the look of amusement (trying to laugh) seeing my wife breakdown was unacceptable.",1,247

i'm spending 4 weeks in cr from the end of july until end of august. i'm looking to book a hostel for a week in puerto viejo ( i'm thinking la ruka hostel if anyone has any feedback).

i then want to spend a week on the pacific side. i was considering spending the week in monteverde, (but i don't know the pacific coast very well). would this be a good choice for a week?

added info:

-my family live in san_jose, so will be based just outside the city for the remaining time.

-i only speak basic spanish and will be travelling solo.",1,107
"Our Twelve Days in Playa Conchal , Rio Celeste, Monteverde, and Uvita with tips","beware long post.  below is a detailed summary of our daily activities as i road tripped around costa_rica with my wife and three children for the last twelve days. i hope it helps others planning on similar adventures.  

day 1: arrival in liberia - guanacaste coast

* 6:20 am arrival = quick customs process.
* pick up 4x4 rental car from alamo
* breakfast at el jardin on the way to the coast. first of many tipico breakfasts.
* chill at the reserva conchal beach club for a few hours (pooolside lunch) as check in at airbnb condo wasn‚Äôt til 3 pm. this was key with jet lagged kids in tow.
* dinner at masala indian restaurant in brasilito- recommend. nearby grocery for breakfast items and road trip snacks.

day 2: la leona waterfall (curubande)

* start the day with breakfast at home, on the road by 7:15am for 9:30am tour
* met our guide at the office in curubande, loaded into the back of a 4x4 pickup for a short bumpy ride to the trailhead.
* lovely hike with some interesting facts about the flora and local legends. not much fauna but for a few birds and butterflies. highlights are the stream crossings and swim traverses to access the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù falls themselves. my 8 yr old pooped out on the return hike, so our guide adjusted for a slightly shorter course. a must do, imo.
* visited up a soda down the street for lunch.  
* kids drained and slept mouth gaped on the drive back to conchal.
* afternoon and dinner at coco loco in playa flamingo. sunset with a coco loco cocktail and kids splashing in mellow waves was hard to beat.

day 3: beach day - playa grande

* breakfast at surf box restaurant in brasilito. great breakfast options, highly recommend.
* short drive to playa grande, swam, sunbathed. it was quite hot and not much shade here. but the kids ranked it their second favorite beach. downtime at the beach club and cleaned up for dinner at gracia at mar vista. amazing sunset views and great food with a pool the kids can enjoy while sipping on a cocktail. highly recommend.

day 4: guanacaste coast to volcan tenorio

* check out of condo and grabbed breakfast at ticoffia coffee shop in liberia, continued drive to rio celeste hideaway hotel. this was the nicest lodging we booked. individual bali style bungalows with a heated pool and lush gardens.  
* afternoon chilling by the pool to decompress after the 2.5 hr drive.
* night tour was included on the property. in one hour saw a sloth, two snakes, green eyed tree frogs, pygmy frogs, and other cool lessons about the environment.
* dinner at the hotel restaurant was fancy and tasty.
* the property has two trails which allow swimmable access in rio celeste (not possible in the national park)! unique perk.

day 5: volcan tenorio continued

* hiked rio celeste trails, enjoying the magnificent falls. kids a bit spent at that point, so cut out borbollones and tenidores sections and sampled pipa frias, sugar cane, and mango from a street vendor for sustenance. ate at a local soda for lunch.  
* back to hotel for a dip, then dinner at tapirus paradiso. good mix of pizza, local fish and a sample of artisanal beer brewed at poas volcano

day 6: volcan tenorio to monteverde

* enjoyed the included breakfast (spotted agouti, coatimundi) and checked out, starting the drive to monteverde. 2.5 hr drive to mv. hwy 145 was the gnarliest section of road in all our 850 miles of driving in cr. plenty of pot holes, hairpin curves, and narrow sections through juntas. the only time we really needed 4x4 capability. alternate routes have been suggested on other threads, worth considering especially if in a sedan
* checked in at valle escondido reserve hotel. a cool, but rustic, property that prides itself on sustainability and permaculture principles. plenty of toucans, coatimundi, amphibians on site. no ac or pool, but would happily stay again. 
* lunch at stella‚Äôs in mv, nice patio with great brunch options. jungle views with several capuchin monkeys and chachalacas passing through.
* back to hotel for sunset and pizza.

day 7: monteverde

* selvatura park for 8:30 am for half day zip lines and hanging bridges walk. super fun, amazing views, easy hike for the kids.
* lunch in mv at the green restaurant- good burgers and shakes.
* afternoon exploring valle escondido property. they have a great trail system with viewing platforms, giant climbable ficus tree, waterfall views, a hammock garden, and great views of the gulf of nicoya.  
* dinner at bon appetite in mv- great pasta. also, a great ipa from monteverde brewing company.

day 8: mv to playa uvita

* longest drive day at 3.5 hrs. hwy 606 out of mv much easier than the previous arrival. costanura sur is a nice stretch of road, easy driving with ocean views. stopped at rico tico in quepos for lunch. expensive, but great ocean view with resident iguanas lounging on the patio.
* arrived at the airbnb in uvita and splashed in the pool until dinner, ordered in from pizza time.

day 9: corcovado np

* one of the few pre-booked excursions we made. 5:00am departure for 1 hr drive south to sierpe. met our guide at the boat launch, an hour earlier than the daily ferries start. 30 minutes on the sierpe river saw squirrel monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans, basilisk lizards. 30 minute ocean segment cruised with resident spotted dolphins.  
* water landing at san pedrillo station. more macaws, other unfamiliar birds our guide pointed out :)
* the hike portion was relatively sparse with only two other (overnight?) groups in the area due to early start. we observed multiple coatimundi, spiders, and the highlight of the day - a tapir moseying along the trail.  
* lunch at the ranger station and short hike to the nearby falls and natural pools. quick boat ride back to sierpe for a full day of sun and fun. this was the highlight of our trip!
* hola india for dinner. turn in.

day 10: playa uvita

* chose playa ventanas to explore. it was a saturday, so plenty of vendors and locals enjoying the beach. rented a canopy and chairs as not much shade. got the tides wrong, so couldn‚Äôt navigate the caves. you can still see straight through, a unique experience.
* lunch at sibu, ice cream next door, and dinner at bistro ballena. highly recommend all three!

day 11: playa uvita to san_jose

* local bakery for breakfast and started the 3 hr drive to sj. easy drive with lunch at moose restaurant in alajuela. highly recommend. shrimp pesto pizza was the bomb.
* paid for a night at hotel alameda caliari, as we had 8 hours to kill before our midnight departure out of sjo. nice mid range hotel with gated parking, swimming pool, and close proximity to the airport.
* rental return as quick and painless as could be (granted 9pm return).  

day 12: sjo - lax - pdx

* typing this up with an hour left on our flight back home. costa_rica has been a bucket list destination for a long time, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. pura vida!

tips: 

* get to know your guides and captains! it‚Äôll make for a richer experience. i recommend maikol marin if you‚Äôre looking for a guide in corcovado. also liked julio at la leona waterfall. these were the only two pre-booked tours.
* built in a down day when transitioning to new lodging, key in keeping our kids sane. plenty of pool time so they were powered up for the big adventures.
* all restaurants were visited on a walk in basis, never had reservations. worked out well for us given plethora of recommendations found on reddit.
* car rental was painless and convenient at alamo, especially after reading about the insurance requirements and horror stories. i shelled out for the extra insurance given the 850 miles we put on the car. worth the piece of mind, and the reduced deposit is back in my account.
* i found driving to be easy, except for hwy 145 through juntas. take the alternate route via 606 to mv. you get used to passing slower vehicles on two lane highways pretty quick. leave plenty of time for commute and enjoy the scenery.
* paid with a cc everywhere we went. used the atm once, not stocked with usd so withdrew colones, which was fine.
* read horror stories about theft, so we were cautious and had our passports with us or in lock boxes the whole time. was always aware of luggage, and kept car viewable when commuting. airtags in a couple bags for piece of mind. no problems.",1,1480

9 nights to kill before friends arrive,"bit of background.  i‚Äôve been to costa 2 times (2007, 2015) and for extended periods.  going again  w a group of family/friends who are not super travellers and live normal suburban lives so more vacation for them but a labor of love for me personally.   we will do typical fortuna/jaco/hermosa/manuel antonio circuit when they arrive. 

however i will arrive 9 days early as to reunite w my girl for her birthday(her first time.) and i can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out where to spend the 9 days without renting a car.  as looking just now they are crazy expensive.  catching buses ect no big deal.  we are both super experienced backpackers of nearly 20 years and spent the last 2 years on the road nonstop w just our small back packs.  i‚Äôm an avid surfer (but my board is arriving later w my friends) and she is all about yoga and spirituality. both pretty fit (for nearly 40) and down for nature hikes etc and also a bit of party.

last time (2015) costa was already super gringo/pricey and this time seems even worse so would avoid tamarindo and the ilk.  as we are unemployed since 2021 budget is primary concern.  interested in santa teresa but concerned with getting there and back. 
i need to be back to either jaco or san_jose to meet my crew.  so don‚Äôt want to stray too far/spend all 9 days on buses.  after friends leave we will spend a month or 2 exploring the caribbean coast before crossing to panama.

ultimately hope this group has the inside scoop on secret cool surf hippie towns that haven‚Äôt been spoiled yet with decent prices. i know it‚Äôs a big ask given all my criteria but still have hope in this community!",1,298

Costa Rica December travel advice,"long time lurker on this subreddit. this would be our first time in cr.  two adults and two kids (11 and 9). i love hiking but not sure how adventurous my wife is.  like everyone i just want the family to have a good time. long adventurous hikes will have to be done some other time.  

i am planing on a trip thats about 11 days. it‚Äôs never enough days but we are also budget travelers. we will be renting a car and staying in airbnbs.  

i was thinking.  

landing in sjo if it‚Äôs early drive out if it‚Äôs late stay the night. 

2 nights around manual antonio
2 nights monteverde
3 nights santa teresa 
4 nights la_fortuna

is this too much bouncing around? is it worth just doing la_fortuna for 5 days and santa teresa for 3-4 ?

we don‚Äôt want to have too much of a packed schedule.  we do want to experience cr but understand you can‚Äôt visit a country like this for less then 2 weeks and have it all.  

is la_fortuna and santa teresa good places to explore and relax ? 

any tips and comments will be appreciated.  most likely rent with adobe or wild rider, leaning towards adobe.

"Transport from Playa Hermosa, Guanacaste","what are the chances of finding a cab from playa hermosa, guanacaste, to liberia airport around 7:30 am? the hotel i am staying at quoted $80 for a private shuttle for my husband and myself, but that seems high. i just don't want to risk not getting to the airport by assuming i can get a cab. any feedback would be great. thank you!",1,64
Getting around La Fortuna/Arenal with a group,"my extended family will be spending a few nights near arenal in july. we have transport from the airport and to our next destination, but as far as getting to the various attractions and sites nearby, i'm not sure what the ideal method would be.

we have 8 adults and 6 kids (ranging from 1yr to 11yrs). i've been to the area, and if it were just my family of 4 (kids age 9 and 7), we'd probably be planning to uber or taxi wherever we wanted to go on a whim. but with a larger group, that doesn't seem as feasible. perhaps it is and that would work well. i'm open to hearing how this option works for others, particularly considering i expect we will break off into smaller groups at some point . 

i know that our hotel can book transport for excursions, but that won't allow for flexibility if we want to stop on the way to and from, or explore the town or surrounding areas, which i feel is a lot of the reason we're going to be in this area.

there isn't an inherent issue with driving ourselves, but with this many people, i think it would mean we'd have to rent 4 cars and i don't think that will be feasible or cost effective. hiring a local guide for a day or two with a van might be something we'd consider, and that might be a great way for them to show us some of the areas we might miss on our own, but not sure how best to go about finding that service.

any other ideas?",1,273
Cold feet about booking August,"i am just about ready to hit purchase on flights for late august and i‚Äôm getting cold feet about the rainy season. first trip to costa_rica, kids will be 9 and 12. planning la_fortuna/monteverde, a couple of days at the beach to relax at the end, 8 nights overall. probably will rent a car for freedom. this seems like a great plan for january or february but could the whole  thing be a bust in august?",1,78
Santa Teresa/ Nosara or Tamarindo?,"hi! a 27 year old female traveling solo to costa_rica third week of april (10 days). first solo travel but an ideal mix of things would be meet new people/ learn how to surf/ do some yoga/ relax/ go out.

initial plan was to go to st but i'm worried it will be a bit too sleepy for 10 days, especially at this time? now debating if i should be doing tamarindo /nosara instead which are a bit less ""secluded"" -- but also the miami/ southern florida vibe reviews i got of tamarindo do not sound as enticing. last thing: lost my driver's license ( :)))) ) -- not sure i can rent out 4x4 for st which i heard is a must?

i am usually an over-planner for trips, but this go around i am just playing the passenger. that said, i feel like i do still need a list of potential things to do while we are there... because it seems no one quite has any plans outside of what time we're meeting for dinner.

it's just 4 adults traveling, arriving at lir on 4/9. we are renting a truck and staying at the westin reserva conchal, leaving on 4/15. we're an adventurous bunch - hiking, paddleboarding, etc.

Costa Rica private shuttle,"my partner and i have been in costa_rica for over a month now, and we have used   u/arenalrides for all of our transportation while we have been here. his service is top tier! we have gone to san_jose, la_fortuna, manuel antonio, and now jac√≥, and he has helped us every step of the way. he hasn‚Äôt always been available to be our driver, but when he isn‚Äôt available, he has found us reliable people to take us where we need to go.

carlos is also just an all around great guy! when we were in la_fortuna, he took us to the mistico hanging bridges and to the arenal volcano. my mom realized that she forgot to bring an sd card with her for her gopro, and between locations, carlos took it upon himself to go find her an sd card. he went above and beyond and we are forever grateful for his hospitality.

and i can‚Äôt forget to mention that carlos helped us book our tours in la_fortuna, and he got us a discount! we went white water rafting and zip lining, and both were amazing.

August Itinerary Feedback,"currently planning a trip for august and hoping for some input on the below itinerary:

* fly into liberia, spend three nights in la_fortuna
* drive to monteverde, spend two nights
* drive to samara, spend two nights 
* drive to tamarindo, spend two nights

after lurking this sub, it seems that most would recommend reducing this trip to two or three stops and spending more time there. we're experienced travellers and like to see as much as possible, but curious if this is simply too much for nine nights. seems like reducing the amount of travel might be ideal in case there is a lot of rain and driving is difficult.

Arenal area La Fortuna tips,"we wrapped up a 3 night trip to la_fortuna on april 1st.
we drove from manual antonio (ma) to arenal and it took us about 5.5 hours with a short stop. if you want to learn some quick tips about ma please look at my other post. https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/1276xji/costarica_manuel_antonio_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

where we stayed:
- we stayed at the jungle beach lodge:
the place was clean, had a beautiful view, pool, and offered a good free breakfast.
the hotel was a literally a 3 minute walk from the waterfall, it had simple clean rooms and good service. for folks looking for a simple lodging with breakfast i would highly recommend this hotel.
tip: 
we asked for the 7am breakfast as we preferred to get up early and out the door. they pack up the breakfast to go if requested.

-arenal volcano trek and mystico hanging bridges:

planning tip: 
we coupled the arenal trek and the mystico hanging bridges for the same day to save time, and gas. both of these attractions are close to each other. we finished the arenal trek, grabbed a quick bite and then did the mystico hanging bridges. both of these activities involve quite a bit of walking so this approach may not work for everyone. 

arenal volcano trek: 
once you arrive at the park entrance, pay for your tickets. you don‚Äôt need to take a pic of their map from the park office. there is a better updated map at the starting point of the trek.
we have a 8 year old daughter and we did this together. this should give folks an idea about difficulty.
if you want to do sector 4 - las coladas (yellow line to old lava flow) or sectors 5 - el ceibo(red line to the ceibo tree) proceed to parking lot two. the trek starts from that lot.
the look out at the end of sector 4 is totally worth it. you see the volcano on one‚Äôs side and the lake on the other. it‚Äôs breathtaking.
tip:
sector 5 is very muddy. please wear appropriate shoes and clothing. i would take a light rain jackets just in case, snacks and water. doing the additional km‚Äôs on sector 5 was worth it for us. the tree alone is massive, it‚Äôs span, it‚Äôs root system was worth the extra calories we burnt :).
we personally didn‚Äôt use a guide. we used one in manuel antonio, how ever we wanted to do this trek at our own pace and needed to be able to increase our speed if needed to complete it faster.
total trek was approx 5 km‚Äôs. 

mystico hanging bridges
we had lunch at the restaurant inside the park. the view from the restaurant was amazing, and the food was excellent including the fresh fruit juices.

the main trail with the bridges takes about 1.5 hours.

tip: 
this may seem obvious but please use the bathroom before you start the trail. there are no bathrooms until you wrap up the trails.
the longer hanging bridges are high and can shake a lot if there are lots of people on them at the same time (max 15 people). we preferred to wait a bit and get on the bridges when there were less people. the shaking doesn‚Äôt suit everyone and certainly not me who is a bit afraid of heights.

la_fortuna waterfall 
there is free parking upfront. we found the parking lot not very busy from 8.00-11.00 am. there are approx 500 steps down and up. our 8 year old handled this with some breaks in between.

tip:
take water shoes, rain coats and or ponchos as it rains often.
take a rash guard as the water is very cold. once you get in it‚Äôs so refreshing. 
it‚Äôs about 16 feet deep in the main waterfall area, there is a nice little river area on the side where most people rest up and swim. lots of fish are there and the kids love it.

hot springs
we went to the titoku hot springs. the reason we chose this spring was due to  less crowds, and as it less touristy. it‚Äôs very small they have about 6 hot springs plus 1 cold spring. when we were there there were two other families.
i wouldn‚Äôt recommend titoku for families and on hindsight i feel we should have gone to baldi which is right next door.
this place is small, there was nothing for the kids to do apart from resting in the hot springs, there were limited sun beds so there was no place for us to launge around unless we wanted to sit on chairs.
the service at the reception and at the bar was great.

restaurants and coffee houses:
-el coloso arenal restaurant:
this is a small restaurant focused on local food. they have tons of other options too.
the food was very tasteful, and the prices were excellent.
we tried the small sized nachos with beef, which were great and enough for 2 people
we tried their seafood fried rice which was sufficient for two adults and their fettuccini chicken pasta.

-arabigos coffee house:
must try for coffee lovers. they‚Äôre known for their cappuccino and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. 
they have their branded coffee beans for sale for 17,000 collone‚Äôs a bag. there is a super market right across and this was super helpful for us to grab snacks, fruits, etc.

-red frog coffee house:
this is a cool little place that does a bit of everything. it‚Äôs across from the el coloso restaurant. they have coffee, meals, souvenirs and cigars etc. they  own the local ice cream joint next door that had excellent ice cream.
their cappuccino was average however loved the service and the experience.",1,955

"Just starting to plan, what are the must-sees? What‚Äôs reasonable?","hi all,

flying into liberia 12/2/23 and staying at the occidental papagayo for a week (resort near playa buena). we plan to do some of the tours/experiences there then rent a car for a second week.

what should we do that second week? we love to hike and are adventurous. we would really like to see animals/visit a nature preserve.

"Itinerary advice, please. Middle of July","we always appreciate reading advice provided to future travelers to costa_rica. we have learned a lot just by reading them.

it is going to be wife and me (60s), with our son and his girl friend (30). we will rent a car for the entire visit.

we would like something beachy and relaxed with nearby.  places to explore and not missing the big places at a not so far distance. our current idea is:

arriving to liberia and then this sequence for a total of 12-14 nights:

a) 4 nights at panama beach (or some other calm-water beach at the gulf of the papagayo)

b) 3-4 nights at fortuna visiting monteverde during one or two days - hiking, watching nature, near volcano and jungle activities.

c) 3-4 nights a good calm-water beach town in salinas bay

a couple of nights somewhere else if worthy.

leaving from liberia.

- hotel three sixty in ojochal (3 nights) - nauyaca waterfall, corcovado, manual antonio natl park

- tabacon in la_fortuna (2 nights) - la_fortuna waterfall, arenal volcano, hot springs 

- el silencio lodge in bajas del toro (2 nights) - waterfall in bajas del toro, other waterfalls on the property

Post trip review,"just wanted to give back to this community after helping plan a great trip :) here is my thoughts and opinions on places we visited!

&#x200b;

in general, we felt safe everywhere and the locals we ran into everywhere were extremely nice people. even a few different people working in the extremely touristy areas gave us honest advice instead of trying to hustle us.

**la_fortuna**

so many things to do here! but make sure you have a car. we all felt safe everywhere, although there was some interesting late night noises in the neighbourhood we stayed in. our favourite food spot of the trip (in terms of price and quality balance) was at pollo fortune√±o. everywhere else we went was either pricier, or not as good.

activities:

tabacon: beautiful spot, but not cheap. we went for a few hours earlier in the day (opens at 10am), and it was actually still good to be there despite it being 30c+ degrees. there is pools of varying temps which helps :) it was good to see in day light, but night time was better experience though imo. i think they do not do half day passes or anything like that which is unfortunate.

el salto: local swim hole with a rope swing. enjoyed this one!

&#x200b;

la_fortuna waterfall: really awesome and beautiful waterfall to chill at. lots of steps to get to it!

&#x200b;

arenal volcano hike: probably overpriced, but enjoyed it and was cool to see. if you aren't going on other hikes i would say do it. but not the end of the world if you miss this one.

&#x200b;

mistico hanging bridges: it was okay, bit of a cool drive to get to it. seen a single monkey, and another animal which i do not know the name of. cool views on some of the bridges, but they are limited capacity so we had to wait quite a bit to cross. i wouldn't go too crazy to squeeze this in, but it's not too bad.

&#x200b;

rio celeste: we actually stayed close to nuevo arenal before doing this hike. the view we had was amazing, probably our favourite stay of the trip. however, i was a bit underwhelmed by the excursion. it is cool to see, i would say stop in if you are passing through, but i would not dedicate a day to it like we did. unless it is your only hike.

&#x200b;

**tamarindo**

too touristy for my liking (wasn't my choice to go here hehe). pricier, not much authentic feel to it. we had very hot weather. the beach was nice and the water was great, but i'm sure there is better down the coast. i didn't enjoy trying to surf here, as there was always multiple people that would go in front of me or get way too close to me. would not recommend, unless you're going for

&#x200b;

**monteverde**

we seen a few monkeys here, and surprisingly didn't get any rain! there is a few trails, we got to the park probably around 1pm and finished by 330 or so (had to catch the 4pm bus). i was pretty disappointed in this one honestly, i was expecting more but it seemed like a boring version of the other hikes we had done before this. the one nice thing about this stop however, was a break from the super hot weather!

&#x200b;

**manuel antonio**

ma national park was great. very touristy area outside of it, and we were being hounded by people trying to sell stuff on the beach (particularly 1 guy trying to sell drinks and would not take no for an answer, after trying many times). however, inside of the park, the beaches were absolutely amazing. the water was really warm -- honestly maybe too much so. lots of monkeys to see which was really great, and we managed to spot a sloth when we ran into a group of tourists that spotted it super high up! these guys are impossible to spot for the average person. we did not get a guide on any hike, but if you are going here and want to see things -- i would say it would be worth it. also, i am happy we were not driving at this point, there was a lot of steep windy narrow roads without guard rails.

&#x200b;

other things:

&#x200b;

we used vamos for our car. they were fantastic to deal with. very relaxed and helpful people. driving was fine on the main highways, but once you get off those they can get bad fast. we drove to rio celeste and ended up on some back roads that were rough. we used interbus and ridecr after ditching our car. communicating with them over whatsapp and the payment methods are a bit weird / sketchy. but i managed to get things booked and they did show up. interbus has wifi which is really nice. had no issues with ridecr, they do not have wifi though. i did have one communication issue with interbus. i was waiting to be picked up at the time given on my ticket, and they didn't arrive til 30-40m later. i had called after 15-20, and the person was able to confirm they were still coming. but it was very worrying for a bit. 

&#x200b;

all in all, super awesome trip, not a cheap place so keep that in mind if you are on a budget. would highly recommend cr!

Itinerary Critiques wanted!,"april 20-may 2
i am going to costa_rica for a bachelorette party (april 27-30) so i decided to extend my trip a little bit and am looking for any feedback on my trip plans so far! we don‚Äôt want to rent a car, we speak spanish and we are trying to keep costs down. 

the bachelorette is in playa hermosa by del coco in guanacaste so we chose brasilito because we wanted a swimmable beautiful beach nearby (conchal) and a less touristy area. i just don‚Äôt see much info about brasilito so i am interested in feedback! i also am a little concerned about staying so far out of town in la_fortuna but i wanted to be by the springs without paying to stay there. 

day 1:
arrive in liberia at 12:45pm
3pm shared shuttle to la_fortuna 
stay at casa torre eco lodge ($219 for 3 nights in a private bungalow) 

day 2:
-mistico hanging bridges, tubing, or la_fortuna waterfall 
-springs resort day pass (we chose casa torre bc it‚Äôs is only a 15 min walk to the resort)

day 3:
-same options for morning 
-springs resort day pass day 2 

day 4:
-shared shuttle to brasilito 
-stay at hotel conchal ($231 for 3 nights) 

day 5-6: 
-bum around brasilito and playa conchal 
-maybe rent atv depending on cost? 
-worth it to get day pass to westin reserva conchal? (~$100)
-maybe check out playa flamingo? 

day 7:
-public bus to playa hermosa, apparently only one transfer in filadelfia so looks easy? 

day 8-11:
-stay at villas sol resort for bachelorette party 
-zip lining at congo canopy 
-snorkeling playa penca
-bar hopping in del coco 

day 12: 
- leave bachelorette resort and stay at m&m beach house in del coco before flight out of liberia on day 13. 


thanks for reading!

Jaco / Playa Hermosa / Playa Herradura review,"**jaco:**

i did not stay in jaco, instead i stayed in hermosa/herradura but i spent a lot of time in jaco through the day and it felt just like any seaside town in europe. i left pretty fast when the sun went down and never stayed later than 6pm.

the beach is very nice, good waves with an easy beach break for beginners. it's also nice to walk on, although parts of it are not the best quality sand. there are enough beach bars and restaurants to stop by and watch the waves. some places did really good food, i think there was a place called the point that was fantastic.

**hermosa:**

i stayed here for a few days and honestly i was quite dissapointed. the beach is nice and there are waves for surfing but there's only one place to rent a board in hermosa and the staff were very rude. there is an amazing argentinian empanadas place in hermosa and the other restaurants are okay-ish but it is just a small strip of shops and beach, not much else.

**herradura:**

more of a resort style in development area with some fancy hotels. the beach itself again is just okay. a couple restaurants but nothing special.

overall, i would recommend jaco for surfing and relaxing but if you are looking for more adventure check out other parts of the country.",1,231

CostaRica Manuel Antonio Tips,"this is my 1st post in the community. reddit helped me so much to plan this trip and i am paying it forward :)
we just wrapped up a 3 night trip ( march 26-29) in ma and we are off to arenal.

1. the ma national park is a must imo. we used a guide and he was super helpful. they helped us spot so many animals that we wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise. 
learnings: 
- take your swim clothes as the private beach restricted to the park entrants only is beautiful.
- hat, sunscreen, bug spray, your own water bottles ( no plastic and or food allowed) are must have items. note: they do a detailed bag check at the entrance and confiscate food and plastic water bottles etc.

2. manuel antonio beach. overall the beach was beautiful, the ocean was amazing.
- don‚Äôt book surf lessons online or through your hotel. we were quoted some ridiculous prices when i checked prices for a surf lesson for my 8 year old daughter.

- there are various surf schools with little huts on the beach. we used glen castro‚Äôs surf school. he is the only company with a red hut. his service was excellent, price was less than 50% of what was quoted online, and my daughter actually stood up on the surf board and had a memorable experience. i highly recommend him. he also allows his surf boards to be used for the entire day after the lesson.

3. restaurants in this area are very expensive. we tried the bus restaurant  (en todas). it was a chill experience as it‚Äôs on the beach. the food was decent. keep an eye on the items you order as they add up pretty quickly. 

- try the costa linda bar and restaurant for food and drinks at excellent value. locals recommended this place to us. we tried the beef fajitas which were great. beers and cocktails were so much more cheaper than all the other restaurants. they also serve breakfast.
- we had a great experience at el avion. i know some folks didn‚Äôt have the best experience with the food. it has great views, the airplane inside the restaurant provides that unique touch. we tried the mahi mahi dish and the shrimp rice. both were good.
- mila olas restaurant is a little gem in quepos. it‚Äôs about a 10 minute drive from
the ma beach. this place had the best meal we had in ma. they have a great local chef who makes some amazing dishes. we tried the octopus which was next level. the prices were lower than el avion and the food was amazing.

4. when driving to ma beach the dudes wearing wests are on the road acting like traffic cops. they can be pretty aggressive as they walk to the middle of the road with whistles. just be careful. i think it‚Äôs ok to pay them to ensure your car is looked after. we didn‚Äôt park on the beach as our hotel was a so close to the beach.",1,513

HELP - Landing in a week! ZERO itinerary.,"ok. title says it all.very last minute trip.4 of us (mom, dad, 13 yr old, 9 year old).this is our first time.

***please, please make as many suggestions are possible!***  
gracias!

04/06/23 - arrival at sjo at noon.transfer to pacuare lodge 04/06 - 04/09/23.

transfer to nayara for 1 night. (hoping extend 04/09 - 04/11)

transfer to beach 04/10 - 04/14. hoping it'll be 04/11 - 04/14 due to extending at nayara.departure from lir on 04/14.

so, that's it. that's all we have.

we haven't yet decided on a beach location. we \*have\* decided that we want an airbnb, though.most locations seem to have their plusses and minuses.we like tamarindo for all the readily accessible beach activities and their vendors.but, we've noticed that even some high end houses have been worn through. i think it's just a given since it's a popular beach. also, the big, touristy crowds aren't a favorite.

is there a beach like tamarindo that has less crowds but with the same activities readily available along the beach??? surfing, water craft?

we enjoy hiking, springs, rafting, zip lining, waterfalls., hanging bridges, , horseback riding, surfing.we're particularly athletic. so, we're up for everything.also, the flora and fauna will be very cool!

Advice for Solo Trip in May,"hi there. i'll be travelling to costa_rica for 10 days for my first time in may for a solo trip. after doing a ton of research i decided i did not want to be tied to 1-2 hotels and i found a company called nomad america who rents 4x4 overlanding vehicles fully equipped with rooftop tent/shower/awning and all camping/cooking gear you could possibly need.

i plan to spend some nights at beach campgrounds and possibly a few others i've found via google maps and all the info they have on nomad americas website. i've watched a ton of vlogs on youtube of other people doing the same trip with nomad america and it seems like a blast!

while i do plan to stay at lodges or hostels a couple times during the trip... what can i expect sleeping in a roof top tent at campgrounds? talking to others who have done the trip makes me feel pretty good about the whole thing, haven't heard too many complaints other than some rough storms while using the tent that sent people to a hotel for the night instead.

 i have no problem with this type of travel and i am used to overlanding and camping in this style as i have my own set up on a tacoma. i live in the desert though so jungle and beach camping will be very different for me.

my very loose plan so far is to pick up the vehicle at 7am when i arrive on sjo and drive south along the coast. i may head to dominical/uvita for a night or two but i would really like to see the osa peninsula and possibly do a tour of corcovado.

advice on solo traveling to the osa peninsula? is it safe enough? how about camping at some of the beaches down there like playa carate or near drake bay?

after several days down south i would likely head back up and check out arenal or monteverde though that part is still up for debate.

any advice would be much appreciated!",1,346

Need Advice: Puerto Viejo or Manuel Antonio/Uvita // Normal Car vs 4WD,"hello,

we (2 people in their 30s) will travel 2 weeks to costa_rica mid to end of april and the route which is pretty basic will definitely include

\- la_fortuna- monteverde- santa teresa

now we thought about doing puerto viejo before and manuel antonio afterwards but for 2 weeks it seems like a bit of a lot, also the internet makes puerto viejo sound a bit crowded and sketchy. what would you recommend:

\- puerto viejo before or- manuel antonio/uvita after

we are looking for nature, beaches, surf. not so much big parties but some nice beach-bar-vibes will be very much appreciated. more looking for """"alternative folks"""" (whatever you make of that) than people in neon tanktops. 

(maybe you will say ""skip santa teresa"" also happy to hear about that)

2nd question: we currently aim for a sedan because it's pretty much half the price of a suv but were wondering if a suv would be necessary.

thanks a lot guys!!",1,163

Etiquette for waterfall swimming,"it‚Äôs my wife and my first time in costa_rica and we are here for 2 weeks traveling around. part of our trip we have been hiking to waterfalls and taking a quick dip and enjoying the nature and nice water. 

yesterday we did a fairly long hike to get to a remote spot we had wanted to see. we finally get there excited because we both a extremely hot and tired and we accidentally run into a couple. the girl is totally naked. they get startled and the guy holds up a towel in front of her while we awkwardly look away. no big deal we back away and wait. we are still wondering around out of site as they are kind of directly in the spot to enjoy the waterfall. 

we give them 5 minutes or so to get on some clothes  and come back. she‚Äôs still naked and now the guy is pissed at us and she‚Äôs shaking her head. he‚Äôs shooing us away and telling us to find our own spot. 

we end up leaving and not really finding a good spot to swim and just hiking all the way back to the car. i feel weird like i intruded on them but at the same time they were in a very public area where anyone could hike to. what gives? i‚Äôve never seen this happen anywhere in the us or any other country. it‚Äôs most likely just an odd couple but wanted to see if there is some sort of etiquette because of how obviously annoyed they were.",1,263
"Trip Review (March 2023) - La Fortuna, Monteverde, Manuel Antonio - Part 2","part 2‚Ä¶

**manuel antonio** - again, so so so happy we came here. we were here for 3 full days but could‚Äôve stayed for a week as we wanted to visit uvita/marino ballena np, nauyaca waterfall, and possibly do a catamaran or mangrove tour. i really don‚Äôt understand the comments of ma being a tourist trap, overly crowded, overpriced, etc. we never experienced this and visited during high season! the beaches were stunning and not crowded at all. the wildlife here is incredible, from our airbnb we saw monkeys, toucans, and macaws everyday. 

**activities:**

- **manuel antonio park:** arrived at 10am and there was no line to get in. the trails weren‚Äôt overly busy either, apart from a few areas near the beach. we parked in the closest parking lot beside sol frozen yogurt for 4000 crc. only one or two people tried to get us to park earlier but nobody was aggressive. without a guide we were able to see deer, various birds, capuchin monkeys, a howler monkey, a frog, and crabs. make sure you bring a reusable water bottle!

- **playa espadilla:** paid $5000 crc one day for 2 chairs and a bed, and $5 usd the next day for the same thing. the beach is gorgeous and not crowded at all. lots of spots to lay down a towel in the shade if you don‚Äôt want to pay for chairs. there is free parking on the road in front of buena vista hotel. there are vendors that try to sell you stuff on the beach but no more than any other beach frequented by tourists. 
 
**food spots:**

- **el avion:** food and service is average but it‚Äôs still worth it for the atmosphere and sunset view. 

- **en todas:** delicious fresh food right by the beach, service is a bit slow but the it was worth it for the food. enjoyed the tacos and quesadillas. 

- **musmanni:** cheap bakery with sweet and savoury pastries. great spot to grab some food for the beach or for a quick breakfast.

- **sabromar:** amazing local seafood restaurant in quepos, great prices, get the red snapper! ended up going here twice because it was so good.

- **cafe agua azul:** beautiful view, came early expecting happy hour but there wasn‚Äôt one, at least not on saturday. the drinks and food were good, not crazy overpriced either.

- **el chante:** affordable spot right outside the park, not the greatest food but good enough for a quick bite after the park. 

- **pops:** great ice cream spot in quepos.

**san_jose** - our flight home is at 10am tomorrow so we opted to spend our last day and night in san_jose. we are staying in a hotel near the city vs the airport since we still have our car. we spent a few hours in the city checking out the central avenue and market.",1,482
"Trip Review (March 2023) - La Fortuna, Monteverde, Manuel Antonio - Part 1","i‚Äôm currently in san_jose spending our last night in costa_rica before we head back home tomorrow morning. i found these types of posts super helpful when planning my trip so i thought i would share mine. this was our itinerary:

day 1 - liberia > la_fortuna

day 2 to 4 - la_fortuna

day 5 - la_fortuna > rio celeste > monteverde

day 6 to 7 - monteverde

day 8 - monteverde > manuel antonio 

day 9 to 11 - manuel antonio 

day 12 - manuel antonio > san_jose 

day 13 - san_jose > home 


**la_fortuna** - we had 4 full days here (including rio celeste) which was the perfect amount of time. it was really convenient having a car to get around as all of the attractions are a bit spread out. with a car we were also able to go everywhere on our own schedule vs having to join a tour which was great. we stayed in an awesome airbnb 15 minutes out of town which i highly recommend if anyone wants the link. if you‚Äôre driving in from liberia, make sure to complete your drive before sunset, our drive in was a bit traumatic as we left a little too late. 

**activities:**

- **la_fortuna waterfall:** enjoyed sitting at the bottom of these falls for a hour, it‚Äôs extremely beautiful! we reached the bottom of the falls at noon, and had no trouble finding a spot on the rocks to relax. it did start to get pretty busy around 12:45. 

- **mistico hanging bridges:** this was the highlight of our time in la_fortuna, probably because it was the first thing we did, and we were just so amazed by greenery. we got there at 1:30 and it wasn‚Äôt crowded at all, we pretty much had the park to ourselves. we didn‚Äôt see any wildlife without a guide, except for a poisonous snake that a worker pointed out. 

- **bogarian sloth trail:** we did a guided tour at 3:00pm and saw 5+ sloths, a toucan, some frogs, an owl, and a bat. if you want to see many sloths and get awesome photos and videos through their telescope, i definitely recommend taking a guided tour. in hindsight, we probably would‚Äôve skipped this tour and taken a guided tour of ma national park instead since there is a larger variety of wildlife there (plus sloths). 

- **mirador el silenco:** we planned to go to the national park but didn‚Äôt realize the last entrance was at 2:30. this park has several trails and only costs $10 usd (vs $25 for the 1968 trail). i recommend the trails that start at the upper parking lot which you have to drive to after entering - nice views of the volcano and a beautiful green lake. the trails are a bit difficult but a lot of fun. they also aren‚Äôt marked very clearly but you‚Äôre able to get by with the map. 

- **ecotermales:** we ended up booking a last minute reservation here and arrived at 7:30 pm. it seemed like tour groups were leaving at this time so it was quite empty. while the property is beautiful as the hot springs are surrounded by greenery, we were bored an hour in. i have been to similar spa experiences in different countries, so i think i just had high expectations going in, and was disappointed. there was no tour/explanation of the property and no map showing the different temperatures of the pool. there were no spots to chill out, apart from a few beach chairs, and no sauna. the change rooms were also quite basic which didn‚Äôt contribute to the spa like experience. 

- **rio celeste:** beautiful waterfall and trails. the hike is somewhat difficult, highly recommended wearing closed toe hiking shoes, it was really muddy and slippery in some areas.

**food spots:**

- **red frog:** had a good lunch here from the ‚Äúsoda‚Äù menu, drinks are huge. 

- **hnos lzos:** really good smoothies at the back of a fruit store, this place didn‚Äôt show up on waze but it‚Äôs right across arabigos coffee. 

- **chocolate fusion choclateria:** a bit expensive but the ice cream coffee drink was delicious. 

- **el comalito tortilleria:** great lunch spot, quesadillas were delicious. 

- **spectacolor:** good flavour, portions are not as generous as local spots but good enough.

- **soda viquez:** delicious fresh food, good prices, huge portions, friendly staff.

- **victorinos restaurant:** best spot in all of la_fortuna, we went here for dinner twice. slightly out of town but amazing food and amazing value. the fried fish was amazing.

- **la choza del maiz:** stopped here on the way from rio celeste to monteverde. great food and fresh juices. 

**monteverde** - i‚Äôm so happy we came here, the scenery was out of this world. we had 2 full days in mv which was just enough time. the drive in from la_fortuna was a bit rough in some areas but once we got closer to mv, the views were beautiful. i suggest figuring out the best roads to drive on vs blindly following waze if you‚Äôre coming in from la_fortuna. we didn‚Äôt have a 4x4 but did have a high clearance suv which saved us. i don‚Äôt think we would have survived the roads with a sedan. 

**activities:**

- **santa elena cloud forest:** got here around 9:30 and it wasn‚Äôt busy at all. the enchanted trail was magical, we also did the youth challenge trail and a bit of the one right at the front entrance. we didn‚Äôt see any wildlife but weren‚Äôt really looking for any either, the greenery itself made it 100% worth it.

- **100% adventura ziplining:** so much fun! online it said the tour would last 3 hours online but it‚Äôs actually only ~1.5 hours. there were many zip lines and also a tarzan swing, rappel, and a monkey bridge included in the price. you could also do the last two zip lines ‚Äúsuperman‚Äù style for no extra cost which was amazing. definitely recommend, i always felt safe and this was actually much cheaper than the other options. their photos are also very affordable.

- **el trapiche coffee, chocolate, sugar cane tour:** family owned spot. good value - lots of samples throughout, we got to make our own sugar cane fudge/taffy to take home and we were provided a small meal at the end.

- **equus monteverde horseback riding:** definitely a highlight of our time in monteverde. we chose the latest tour so we were able to catch the sunset. the property is gorgeous with stunning trails. i also felt super safe on the horses, even though i was a total beginner. 

**food spots:**

- **la cocina dona mayra:** good casual spot for lunch. affordable. great juice.

- **bon appetit:** this place is good if you‚Äôre looking for a fancier meal and italian food but it is more expensive than the other places around. 

- **sabor tico:** possibly the best meal we had in costa_rica. generous portions, delicious flavourful food.

- **tico y rico:** a bit more expensive than other spots but a convenient location. the portions were massive so it was still good value.",1,1204

Another Car Rental Questions (ugh),"this car rental stuff is driving me crazy.

i am being quoted by payless, avis, usave, and nextcar on expedia like $50 for 2 weeks. i know that's without the mandatory liability insurance, however i can't figure out how much they will charge for mandatory liability insurance. i am reading that for a regular car it's not going to be more than $20 per day.

so, then can i then safely assume my car rental will cost no more than like $25 when all is said and done? are there more fees/tricks i'm not realizing? i can afford $25 per day, but other people saying average it's $50 day, which i can't afford.

any help is appreciated. it's making it impossible to plan my trip. thanks

"La Fortuna + Samara: our trip, recommendations, tips, etc. Loved it!","we recently went to la_fortuna for 4 days and samara for 4 days and had an absolute blast. here are some notes about our trip -- i hope this helps people who are looking or planning! i came to this subreddit a lot when planning our trip so am very appreciative to folks here and wanted to return the favor.

overall, we had an awesome trip. the people, the views, the wildlife -- 100% would recommend.

in general, we tried to limit ourselves to 1 activity per day which ended up being just right for us. given our two kids (3 and 6 years old), had we done two activities it would have been too much. we mostly did structured stuff in the morning, and kept the afternoons free for exploring.

la_fortuna:

\- we rented from vamos rent-a-car which went really smoothly. no hidden fees, they communicated a lot ahead of time about insurance and car seats, they picked us up right from the airport and everything went as expected. we got the insurance through them which ended up being very reasonable. driving was totally fine.

\- we stayed at the lost iguana and really enjoyed it! it felt pretty immersed in the rainforest, had a very chill vibe and felt remote which is what we wanted. really amazing, amazing views of the volcano. no big tour buses, no big crowds. two small pools, one heated and one cold but the pool never felt busy. it was exactly the vibe we wanted and were looking for. biggest/only downside was that the food left a little to be desired: breakfasts were totally sufficient -- buffets with eggs, pancakes or french toast, plantains, fruit. dinners were pretty meh so we opted to eat in town most of the time for dinner which was fine because we had a rental car. lots of folks comment about how hilly this property is and, yes it is, but it was never an issue for us.

\- favorite activity in la_fortuna: guided hanging bridges tour. definitely get a guide! we got one of the guides via their main website. without a guide i doubt we would have seen much of the wildlife we saw. with the guide we saw: spider monkeys, howler monkeys, sloths, poison dart frog, boa constrictor, and more. we also learned about the plant life, insects etc. the hanging bridges themselves were insanely cool and had unforgettable views.

\- second favorite thing: zip lining with arenal ecoglide. we did this instead of sky adventures because our daughter is too young/short for sky adventures. this was totally amazing. they had our daughter with a guide so she zip lined with another adult, our 6 year old went on his own with no issue. 20+ zip lines, a tarzan swing. amazing views the whole time, truly wonderful.

\- hot springs at tabacon was beautiful. admittedly, a whole day there felt long even though we scheduled it on a day between two very active days. and, at the end of the day i found out we weren't supposed to submerge because of some super rare brain eating amoeba, so that put a damper on it because of my anxiety-ridden brain lol. but my own anxiety aside, the food there was incredible and there was plenty to explore. could i go back and do it again, i wish we'd done the natural hot springs at el chollin first, and then tabacon for the rest of the day but it was also really nice to just have a whole day to relax.

\- on the last day we did the bogarin sloth trail. the people were lovely, but we saw a lot of the same animals we saw on the hanging bridges tour. the best part of this tour was hearing about the history of la_fortuna and the volcano from our guide which was honestly more interesting to us than it was to our children. upside was that this tour was totally flat. hanging bridges was a lot more uphill hiking/walking which was fine for us, but if you can't do that this is a good alternative.

\- food in la_fortuna: we liked red frog coffee, soda viquez, and pollo fortuneno

samara:

\- we stayed at the hideaway hotel. so, this place was clean, safe, food was really yummy and we enjoyed it. that said, if we could go back or do it again we'd try to stay at a place that is actually on the beach. it was a short walk to the beach but with little kids it was kind of annoying to have to schlep. that said, there's really very little to complain about here, we ran into lots of families who had stayed there before and returned -- it was mostly our personal preference to be closer to the beach. there was a ton of cool wildlife, a million howler monkeys in the tree, a giant iguana roaming the grounds. we had left the rainforest but it still felt really immersed. the staff was attentive and kind, and it was nice to stay at a place that had delicious food on site.

\- we all took surf lessons with pato's surfing and they were great. we have young kids - a 3.5 year old and a 6.5 year old - so they got us 2 instructors who basically went 1:1 with our kids in the water for 90min. we all successfully stood up which was fun. cannot recommend these folks enough!!

\- playa carillo was gorgeous, and hot hot hot. we brought a big bag of fruit and ice which helped a ton, swam, checked out the vendors selling coconuts and ceviche. a really cool spot, just make sure you bring lots of water, fruit and/or sunblock!

\- playa samara was also beautiful, if you go down into town and on to the beach, there's a spot to rent umbrellas and chairs ‚Äî we didn't have time to do this but it's a really nice beach, if we had another day we would have 100% rented stuff and just hung out beachside for the day.

\- food in samara: cantina de baco was awesome (tapas place). we went at around 4pm so it was pretty empty, they had a swing for our kids + toys. very cool. el lagarto on the beach was solid as well.

driving:

\- we flew in to liberia airport, drove to la_fortuna, then drove to samara, and then drove back to liberia. all in all it went very smoothly. the shortest and easiest drive was samara to liberia. longest/hardest was la_fortuna to samara. definitely recommend dramamine if you have young kids, ours got car sick on almost every leg.",1,1127

i‚Äôd like to stay relatively close to san_jose so i don‚Äôt spend so much time (and money) traveling. i enjoy beaches, nature, animals, historical sites/architecture. for activities i enjoy hiking, walking around exploring the town, eating at restaurants. are there any interesting (walkable preferably) small-medium sized towns within 2-3 hours (by bus preferably) from sjo?

all three of our kids are off to camp kanakuk for two weeks in june, so she and i will be spending eight days in costa_rica together just the two of us. we love fancy dining, exploring cities and the countryside, really we are down for anything that we can do. making macarons? hell yes. a boat through a weird cave? bring it on. michelin star, sure, also cool with gas station tacos.

if there‚Äôs a balls-out amazing resort we will probably be happy chilling, but i have the number of a handicap van and driver who can take us around the countryside if there are some things worth seeing?

anyway, thanks for your help, weird request. make the most of every moment, somehow without stressing about doing so.",1,178

"Trip Recap-Jaco, Manuel Antonio and La Fortuna","thanks to this subreddit for all of the help planning our trip, i figured i'd give back by sharing some tips and tricks we learned on our 10 day vacation that we took mid-march. we did 4 nights in jaco, 3 in manuel antonio and 3 in la_fortuna. fwiw- we are a 20-something couple with mixed tastes for adventure vs. chill vacations.

**accomodations:** 

1. **jaco- croc's resort and casino**\- we started our trip in jaco, which was actually an add-on to our original, shorter vacation when we came upon extra vacation days. we weren't super hype on it because of mixed reviews from this subreddit but it far surpassed our expectations. croc's vibe was low-key overall. the pools were very nice and pool bar food and drinks were great and reasonably priced. there were some families with kids but not a ton. the casino was very understated and we never saw more than a few people inside during our stay. this hotel had the nicest gym of our trip with a number of cardio and weight machines and a spacious interior. 
2. **manuel antonio- gaia hotel and nature reserve-** a stunning property. rooms are (i believe) all suites with 2 rooms, massive bathrooms and private balconies. the restaurant, la luna, was one of the best dinners we had on our entire trip. all of the staff knew us by name and room number and really went above and beyond. you are paired with a concierge upon arrival who you can chat with via whatsapp and can help coordinate transportation, reservations, excursions, etc. the hotel has an hourly shuttle to the beach where you have to pay appx. $10/day for chairs and umbrella. the private nature reserve offers a complimentary daily walking tour. we didn't really see any animals on ours but the guide was knowledgeable and passionate about protecting habitats for animals. there are a number of sloths, monkeys, macaws, etc. that independently roam the property as well. the gym left a lot to be desired. a few machines and free weights but the gym is a separate building in the parking lot that has no ac and functions, essentially, as a natural sauna because of how hot it gets.
3. **la_fortuna- the royal corin-** lovely, large rooms with volcano views and spa showers. the hot springs are hot and we could happily have a drink in the pool bar but definitely have to hop out for a break after one drink. the hot springs are heated via aqueducts that move the volcanic heat up to the surface to heat the pools so the springs aren't entirely natural like they are at ecotermales. skip the restaurants for dinner, but their buffet breakfast was 10/10. the gym was very small (some free weights, 1 treadmill, 1 bike and 1 weight machine) and required reservations in advance. also very, very hot inside.

**travel:** we opted not to rent a car due to discomfort with driving on the narrow, winding, mountainous roads between towns and opted to take private shuttles for transportation to/from the airport from the hotels and mainly had concierges/restaurant staff call us taxis for regular trips. taxis only take cash, colones or usd, but typically had appropriate change for us. we only had success with getting ubers a few times, mainly in la_fortuna. 

**packing:** we are glad we opted entirely for casual clothing options- quick-dry, sweat wicking shirts and shorts during the days and lightweight dresses, shorts and short sleeve button downs for dinners. we mainly wore sneakers for most excursions (zip lining, hiking, national parks), casual sandals and birkenstocks for dinners, and teva sandals for beach, waterfall swims. 

**excursions:** 

jaco- in addition to surfing and beach time, we did the one-day isla tortuga tour via costa cat cruises and a trip to los suenos adventure park. costa cat was expensive but worth it- 45 min. ferry ride to isla tortuga where you reach a private beach and have chairs with umbrellas, a delicious included casado lunch, a short snorkeling trip (about 30-45 mins with a short boat ride out and back), and banana boats. we did zip lining at los suenos which had people of all ages- 6 years to 70 years and was a good use of a few hours. 

manuel antonio- we did a small group guided tour of the park at 7am when they opened- definitely suggest doing the earliest tour possible before it gets too crowded and while the animals are most active. the guides worked together to spot some monkeys, sloths, frogs, iguanas, etc. with their scopes and visitors took turns looking through the scopes to see closer. we were going to do white water rafting but opted not to due to the rapids being a bit rougher than what we were prepared for. the public beaches are very nice and the waves are small. water was incredibly warm. 

la_fortuna- would 100% recommend the full-day arenal volcano/hanging bridges/waterfall trip from green vacations. if we didn't have a guide, it would be entirely unlikely that we would have been able to spot any animals, but the guides are so well trained (shout out to pepe) that they can smell monkey poop to indicate where to look with their scopes. we were nervous about how long the day would be but we left feeling energized. i will say, the day required a moderate level of physical activity to keep up on all of the walking. separately, we did a coffee/chocolate tour at north fields farm which was also a highlight of the trip if you are interested in the process of growing, harvesting and making these products. 

**dining:** 

jaco- recommend el manglar and el hicaco for dinner. we had a casual dinner at puddle fish brewery as well. the sodas are good for lunches and causal breakfasts too. 

la_fortuna- we ate at pollo fortueno which came recommended highly from this sub but we were unfortunately, disappointed. we had better meals at more off-the-beaten path places like china la familia feliz which was a spectacular peruvian-asian fusion restaurant. 

manuel antonio- la luna was amazing. get the costa_rican casserole. falafel bar also really yummy. skip ronny's place. the food was very meh. 

**other things we learned:** 

* while everywhere accepts usd, they will absolutely not accept a bill that is even a little bit ripped. 
* most everywhere also accepts credit card, amex included. 
* the beaches are very firm, hard sand. perfect for walking and running on, less great for laying in the sand. the ocean waves are mild-moderate in the areas we visited, perfect for learning to surf or for kiddos to swim. 
* we didn't have any issues with people trying to trick us/take advantage of us as tourists. everyone we met was very nice and appreciative of us. my boyfriend speaks moderate spanish so that was also helpful, although most people aside from taxi drivers spoke english as well. 
* jaco didn't seem overly ""party vibe"" to us. on the nights we were back at the hotel by 10pm we didn't see any evidence of excessive partying. actually, the town felt very laid back beach vibes. 
* restaurants close on the early side- most by 9:30/10ish",1,1208
Hotel Punta Islita!,"my husband and i will be flying into lir and heading down to hotel punta islita at the end of april/early may. we're excited to spend some time relaxing and experience pura vida! this is a make up honeymoon for us after being delayed from the pandemic. we are looking for some relaxation, rest, and nature related activities (hiking, bird watching, viewing sea turtles and howler monkeys). 

i have seen some posts saying that one week is too much to spend at the remote resort so i am feeling a bit uncertain on what to expect. i  would love to hear experiences from anybody who has been! we will not have a rental car. specific questions i have:

- is the food at the hotel hit or miss? we are planning to also visit a couple of places nearby and support the local community. 
- what activities were included in your stay? what did you pay for? 
- should we expect a lot of rain since it's the start of the green season? 
- any critters/bugs/dangerous creatures that we need to look out for? 

also, if anybody is heading there, and interested in sharing the costs for a shuttle from lir to hotel punta islita, feel free to dm me. the hotel said their transportation takes up to five people in one shuttle.

would anyone recommend a travel agency? or is that viewed as a waste of money? i‚Äôve never used one before but have also not traveled extensively outside of the country except to visit family. also, are restaurants generally walking distances to hotels in la_fortuna or should i make sure to look for hotels that have a lot of amenities or is close to town?",1,187

Can you vet my CostaRica Itinerary?,"i'm 27m from canada. looking to go somewhere warm for a 16-18 night ""workation."" i will be working about 7 hours each weekday and then wanting to meet and connect with other travellers to have a good time. it wouldn't hurt to meet a lady or two along the way.

my budget is very flexible. i want to optimize for the right vibes, which to me is all about the type of people i get to meet (social, interesting, diverse)

current itinerary plan;
- fly into liberia and immediately go to tamarindo
- tamarindo for 7 nights (likely at selina tamarindo hostel)
- bus/drive to santa teresa
- santa teresa for 8 nights (likely at lost boyz hostel)
- bus/drive to liberia and head back to canada

in terms of things to do, i figured i would just see what the people i meet there are doing, and tag along. i like volleyball, spikeball, dancing, hiking, and especially motorbiking. pretty much anything other than surfing (its a shame, i know).

From My US Friend Living in Costa Rica About CoronaVirus,"not much good news from costa_rica. we are seeing a huge spike in new cases and deaths, scary. may and june we were getting single digit new cases a day with only ten dead. driving restrictions and closed beaches, bars, hotels, restaurants and non essential business were closed. we were doing pretty well, then early in july the government allowed most of those places to open. our cases went from under ten a day to nine hundred thirty one yesterday with ninety eight dead. the hospitals are at capacity, with only six icu beds available in the country. it‚Äôs much worse than a month ago and get this, the government is going to open the airports for some international flights starting august second, none from the us. what the fuck are they thinking ? i don‚Äôt understand, the virus is getting worse and they want foreign tourists to come to rainy cr. it sounds like a page out of trumps playbook. crazy. i thought our president and health minister had better sense but they caved in to the minister of tourism to get the economy back. i believe it is a disaster in the making. we‚Äôll see.

My experience with the Costa Rica airport so far.... not great,"so i have been planning on coming in for a while.  we have a overland truck rental with nomad all setup and a stay at secrets resort for the second week. 

we flew in last week due to having points with alaska airlines.  we planned on going to roatan to a dive resort for a week.  copa airlines cancelled the flight we were on, but we were able to get a last minute work around.  got the insurance for the entire time, got the covid test etc. 

as we were about to board, we were asked to fill out an online form with our phone. (good thing we have smartphones and they weren‚Äôt dead). got that done just to walk through the airport and get on a flight out of the country.  

be advised, they want a pic of your insurance info attached to the questionnaire.  they barely looked at the insurance info, if at all. after you fill out the questionnaire, it will generate a qr code. this is what they scan to pull up your info. 

fast forward a week where we are coming back into costa_rica.  they did not have a qr code at the departure gate so she had to research the website.  we went and hit the button that said to modify an existing questionnaire.  

as we were going through customs, we were flagged, and escorted two gates down.  by bus.  that we had to sit and wait in.  get to the special screening gate, and they told us we had to fill out a new questionnaire,  and redoing the old one flagged us. we did that and were allowed to get back in line to get through customs.  they were not interested in seeing a covid test. 

then we had to wade through aggressive taxi people to get to our shuttle.  if you get a taxi, get a price before you get in the cab.  very few shuttles have the hotel names they are driving for, but there are guys there doing a lot of shouting that can point you in the right direction.  i think they get a cut if they flag you or something. 

a few takeaways for those going through: have your passport number, dates, and hotel or where you might be staying address to be able to put on the form.  keep your smart phone charged up to use for all of this.  know where you are going when you arrive and a plan to get there.

Overstaying Visa,"i‚Äôm living in pacific central cr doing a work trade for a few months, and at current my flight home (usa) leaves 15 days after my 90 days visa ends. the cost of changing my flight to within the timeframe of my visa is over $300, and i‚Äôm finding that it costs $100 per month overstayed. a visa run will cost me far more than $100 from where i am. logically it‚Äôs more sensible to simply pay the fine upon departure. 

my questions are, is the $100/month fine true, and how do you go about the process of paying the fine? 

i apologize if this is in opposition to the ‚Äúkeep it legal‚Äù rule on this sub. it‚Äôs mostly legal, though, as i am going to pay the fine...

Safety and Costa Rica?,"in many threads here and online, i somewhat feel they are giving an outdated outlook on how safe costa_rica is for tourists. honestly, i felt a bit misguided from reading some of these sentiments. 

when i read or hear some of the long and extended future travel plans from people, all i can do is wish them all the luck because it's not a journey i'll risk. from my (limited) experience, even the tourist destinations in costa_rica do not feel particularly safe and welcoming to tourists. the economic situation in costa_rica may be adding to a lot of distress and i can totally understand how some locals feel that they can't even afford to live in their own country, but the tourists can. heck, i can't even afford to live there to be honest. the cost of living seems unreasonably high while the economic opportunity in certain locations definitely not enough.

The long gone ‚ÄúPura vida‚Äù,"i am a costa_rican who has lived in california for 20 years and visit cr 3 or 4 times a year. my last trip was to montezuma and santa teresa, and my experience was disappointing!
the expression ‚Äúpura vida‚Äù is a cultural lifestyle that any costarican knows and provides to everyone! is the sweet smile and warm welcoming that they provide when they meet you personally or when they serve you in a hotel or a restaurant. 
foreign business owners in the areas of montezuma, santa teresa and and other regional beaches fail to understand what ‚Äúpura vida‚Äù means. 
the foreigners, owners and running business in these part of the country did not like the costarican pura vida life, so they changed it into their own perspective of what ‚Äúpura vida ‚Äú should be for them! 
3 nights of eating in different restaurants in the area, none of the people working were costarican, they were from other countries,  
   if you are a foreign business owner in cr remember that tourism in cr is base in the pura vida life! beautiful beaches, good food and tropical weather tourist can find in many other countries but the pura vida life only in costa_rica.

3 nights in la_fortuna, followed by 2 nights in jaco and last 4 nights in manuel antonio. we will be renting a 4x4 car.  


we leave soon but nothing is booked so we are totally open to changing the itinerary. i came across some posts on reddit that say manuel antonio is super touristy. then i started to get intrigued by puerto viejo instead.

US Resident wanting to come for 3 months,"i‚Äôve been in this group long enough to get the general sentiment towards us residents wanting to come to cr when the borders open and i totally understand it. safety and lives matter more than anyone‚Äôs vacation plans.

Stuck in Tamarindo for the Night,"we were having a little too much fun in tamarindo beach this evening that we lost track of time and now we cannot drive back to san_jose. i have a couple questions:

1. the drive from san_jose to here was a bit scary...or let me be clearer. we drove during the middle of the day so it wasn‚Äôt scary, but we thought about how scary it would be to drive through those highways at night. we stayed at the dir√≠a last night and checked out today with the intent to explore this side of costa_rica for the day and then drive back before the sun set. again, the beach was so fun we lost track of time.

2. there are no vacancies for us to stay here again, except at the dir√≠a for a crazy $250 a night. my question is: is there a couple here that has a double-bed room that would let us crash with you guys for the night? we‚Äôll pay you $100. we are a normal couple, 30 yo male 39 yo woman.

 i'm about to book a trip to costa_rica but what is everyone's experience with the national parks shutting down at around 4pm? the opening hours for most of them seem to be 6am- 4pm. first of all, i don't enjoy waking up in the middle of the night to go hiking at dawn. second, what happens if a hike lasts longer than expected and you don't make it back for 4pm? are there scary consequences? and also, for people who have experience travelling in this country, when the beaches and hikes in the np close, are there still surrounding areas of interest that can occupy your time in the early evening/night time? because i'm not sure what else i will want to do in these areas other than see the national parks.

help please! 

we would love to not spend our vacation driving from place to place. but would rather have 2-3 base camps: 

we're absolutely up for anything and... 

we want to: see sloths and other animals/birds but especially sloths

walk the hanging bridges and /or do a zip-line canopy tour 

see/hike a volcano

hike to waterfall(s)

take a couple of days 2? 3? 4? of surf lessons

go white water rafting

go out on a boat (lessons? ) see whales and/or dolphins other sea life

go snorkeling

relax for a few days in a nice hotel and do nothing. 

maybe: horse back riding, hot springs, mineral baths... 

we‚Äôre not drinkers/partiers but also not looking for secluded/romantic.  

we‚Äôve got a 14 (going on 25) year old with us so we‚Äôd like to be around other folks. 

we would like to support local establishments whenever possible and keep our footprint minimal.   

some wonderings: 

do we need all reservations in advance?   
 do we need to rent a vehicle? 

we‚Äôre used to low key travel‚Ä¶ go where the wind takes you‚Ä¶ but we also used to travel for months at a time. this trip is only‚Ä¶ we have up to 3 weeks - but husband might not be able to relax for that long b/c of work stuff.   


disclaimer:   
husband can't do heights but knows mom and kid plan to zip line and walk the canopy - hopefully in one day though.   
mom and kid get violently car sick... this is a problem everywhere... but limiting drives that are ""just for fun"" is good.

i‚Äôve never been to cr but have traveled in argentina, chile and panama. i researched a lot and i zeroed in on those places because i think i want a smaller funky place with yoga, fresh organic food, chill vibes. somewhere we could park for a few weeks and just chill with our baby, wander the beach, walk to dinner and coffee and yoga classes, be outside a lot. go on a few side trips maybe if we have the energy. 

one thing i worry a little about is feeling anxious if we‚Äôre too far away from a hospital, just with the baby being so young and my potential postpartum anxiety levels. or if we need to drive an atv everywhere‚Ä¶ i also worry about getting bored if we go too a small of a place.

Where are my fellow divers at?,"we're in the the preliminary stages of planning a trip for late summer.

what we know:
about 10 days, in and out of lir, last 3 to 4 days at tabacon. (unless someone can suggest a better alternative for the same or less money) 

what we want, but don't have planned. probably in guanacaste.
we'd like to find either a resort with a decent diving set up for 6 to 8 dives, food, on the water, or we're open to the vrbo do it on our own route like we do in bonaire. 
rocket frog keeps coming up for diving. 

i've looked at liveaboards, they tend to be way more spendy than we want to spend, and of course flexibility is an obstacle.

sixt looks like they have extremely reasonable car rental rates.  any issues with a small car handling the roads between lir, guanacaste, and tabacon? 

suggestions on guanacaste area resorts or small vacation rentals in the water?

suggestions for dive operators and auto rental?

any other relevant info?",1,170

Where can you currently travel to from Costa Rica? How to organise cheap 'throwaway' onward travel whilst adhering to Covid restrictions?,"my partner and i are looking to fly to costa_rica following the borders opening on the 1st of august. we will be looking to go at the end of september and will be house-sitting for just under 3 months.

we are aware that when arriving in costa_rica that it is important to have onward travel confirmed. we are currently unsure of what our next move will be after costa_rica as we would like to continue our travels as opposed to returning home. 

i would like to know what our options are, and which countries borders are allowing travel from costa_rica?

if we were unsure of our onward travel, i imagine the obvious recommendation would usually be to book a cheap bus out of the country to one of costa_rica's neighbours. however, if travel isn't permitted around central america at our time of flying - will this count as accepted onward travel or will it be disregarded due to it's current state of unfeasibility?

Traveling in October - Mistake or adventurous idea,"hi costa_rica fans,

&#x200b;

my girlfriend and i were so enthusiastic about costa_rica that we only read two blogs where it mentioned something about the weather. the blogs both stated that costa_rica is a great place to visit all year round.

now that we've done some more research we start to notice a lot of people advice to avoid costa_rica during the rainy period (especially october). some others say october is a good time to visit this wonderful land because of its greenness.

we can't go to the caribean coast due to malaria (medics advice us not to go there due to our conditions). so we will be visiting guanacasta, puntarenas and alajuala. our main goal is to see nature and visit some parks (manuel antoni and corcovado).

Should Costa Rica allow fully vaccinated visitors without insurance and other COVID requirements,"i was speaking to a friend and he told me he had insurance for 10 days and got the visa only for 10 days. at the end of 10 days, he was not done with his business dealings but had to leave as he had only a 10-day visa. maybe costa_rica can allow visitors to 30 or 90-day visas. just a thought!

he usually spends $300/day and costa_rica lost that revenue since his visa was only good for 10 days. something to think about. 

also, i have spoken to many americans who are fully vaccinated and prefer not to pay 'extra insurance'  and it may be helpful for costa_rica to allow the fully vaccinated americans/canadians/europeans/etc. without insurance or other covid requirements.

i am not looking for smart comments just wanted to see what this community's thoughts were.

importantly:
how bad is coronavirus currently - are hospitals overflowing, many deaths, etc? 
to what extent has normal life resumed for costa_ricans?
are dorm-based hostels largely open?
are bars/restaurants largely open?
are tourist sites such as trails etc open?
is mask-wearing normal in public - for example on the beach?
has public transport resumed (we will only be able to afford to take buses - no car rental)? 
what is the current attitude towards coronavirus - is there still widespread fear?

Bringing weed from the US,"so i‚Äôm going to costa_rica sometime in october (2022 for anybody reading this post after that) i have read a lot of things about bringing weed into costa_rica. the first reddit page everybody was for bringing carts and gummy‚Äòs. but the second one there were a lot of people saying that it wouldn‚Äôt be smart. i have vacuum sealed smell proof bags and i want to bring a joint or two. i also plan on bringing a cart and maybe some gummy‚Äòs because i‚Äôve had experience with both of those things at the airport and i‚Äôve had zero problems but that was traveling within the united states. i‚Äôve also brought back joints from california to florida in the past and with those same vacuum sealed bags and had zero issues. i do not plan on bringing anything but the cart back from costa_rica since i‚Äôm obviously not going to smoke the whole thing in one week. any thoughts and advice would be great but do not be one of those people that says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring it that‚Äôs stupid you‚Äôre gonna get caught‚Äù and have no reasoning behind it other than your own ignorance about weed in general. please come with actual advice with logic behind it and that would be greatly appreciated!

Why so many clueless foreigners ?,"hey,

just got back from costa_rica. fantastic country to visit. all was perfect for me and my girlfriend. 

the only thing that irritated me were the countless clueless tourists all around. you walk around san_jose. all locals wear masks even outside. you look around and the only people not wearing one are tourists. 

you may disagree with mask mandates etc but shouldn't you do as locals do??? i felt sorry for the locals. it must be infuriating to see most tourists not respecting what they do.

i was waiting at a bus station. to enter, you need a mask, to wash your hands and take your temperature. the security staff always had to ask tourists to do those. many entered and tried to skip the hand washing and temperature taking. same when they sat. after a couple minutes, they would try to put their masks under their chin as if nobody around would notice...

why are people so damn clueless about these?!? you could spot tourists in a crowd just by spotting people without masks. it was ridiculous at this point and mildly infuriating.

(fyi i also did a long stopover in m√©xico city for 48 hours and the same happened. locals wear masks even outside when other people are around. not most tourists...)",1,216
Itinerary Sharing Platform,"hi, alex here. i recently launched a crowdsourced travel itineraries platform with three colleagues/friends of mine. it's called itinsy.

we've been live for a few months but already have close to 600 itineraries that folks have posted. the idea came to me about two years ago on a trip to italy with my wife where i had not done any research ahead of the trip (she had done all of it and was upset with me), but redeemed myself a bit when i got a few itineraries from colleagues who had taken similar trips before.

so i thought it would be extremely useful for the world to have a free platform where all itineraries could be shared. that's how it was born. on the platform, you're able to search and filter for itineraries based on destination, month, length of stay, cost and trip type for the perfect trip. by trip type, i mean using tags like #nationalparks or #hiking.

some other features include:

* ability to build a travel profile of all locations you've been to and a visual map with pins that you could share with friends/family.
* save, react to, and give kudos to other itineraries
* social feed to connect with like-minded travelers, ask questions, form groups and get advice - message and follow users too.
* fun community experience with points, coins, badges, rewards, reputation scores

to encourage folks to post their itineraries, for now, we are giving away amazon gift cards for each itinerary that's shared.

firstly, i wanted to share here because hopefully it's of interest to folks planning their trips to costa_rica.

here are some costa_rica itineraries that folks have shared on the platform.

secondly, very open to feedback and ways we can improve / other features you would like to see. feel free to email me directly ([alex@itinsy.com](mailto:alex@itinsy.com)) or share your feedback below.

What happens if we test positive in CR?,"hi all! 

just want to start by saying i am fully covid aware and precaution/mask compliant. this question is being asked from a place of logistical curiosity. i am neither a denier or a believer that precautions and standards are ‚Äútyrannical‚Äù etc. 

i am traveling with my husband to cr in mid-february. it will be our second trip there, but the first since covid happened. we obviously plan to get tested in order to board our flight back to the us as per the cdc requirements. 

if for some reason we end up with a positive test, what happens next? does the cr government have specific hotels/areas in which we are expected to isolate until we are negative? is it our responsibility to find accommodations that will take us? i know our travel insurance is meant to cover the cost of housing during our quarantine, i just don‚Äôt quite understand the practical mechanics if/when we have a test come back positive.

Is The Border Opening To US Citizens August 1st?,"hi everyone! i am planning to visit costa_rica eventually this year as a tourist. however, while reading the news, it‚Äôs very unclear if american citizens are allowed into costa_rica (the news just states that flights from the us into costa_rica are currently pending according to both the tico times and the us state department website). so does anyone know if americans will be allowed into costa_rica? thanks in advance.",1,73
Is this normal behaviour for men from Costa Rica?,"don't know if this is the right place to ask, but here goes. i had a fling with a tourguide from costa_rica. he drove three hours for a ons. he was telling me he didn't just come for sex he also liked me as a person etc. i didn't take it very seriously. he also talked about never having felt his way, before me he had given up on finding a woman, we have so much in common, wanting to come visit me in my country too and all that jazz. i made it clear i didn't expect any of that and it's cool if it's just one time sex, that's what i intended. but he persisted in his narrative of me being 'special'. the next morning he seemed very distant. i sent him a message for closure along the lines of 'it was a great experience and safe travels back', and some silly photo. he only responded to the photo with a smiley and not the rest of my messages. all other messages after that have been ignored. is this normal, that ticos will tell you such dramatic things thinking it will get you more horny or something? i don't really see the benefit of going overboard like this. isn't it enough to just tell you you're pretty, it was already clear i wanted sex and didn't need convincing...can anyone shed light on this?

"Eat, Pray, Love trip.

Car Rentals in San Jose are super cheap?,i am looking online at priceline and kayak and it's showing like $3-6 a day. is that normal for it to be so cheap. even when i go all the way to checkout it still is that price? seems so low? is this normal? i am in costa_rica now and was thinking of grabbing one.,1,56
Is my budget for a 15 day stay in Costa Rica realistic?,"here's my the breakdown of my budget. the prices in green are those that are either paid for, or include a comfortable margin of error. this is a 3 person trip, and prices are per person.  100$ for gas means we expect to pay 300$ in gas for the 15 day trip. ""logement"" is french for lodging.

&#x200b;

the main points i'd like some opinions on are the food, surfing and national park budgets. we are spending 5 nights in monteverde, 2 nights in arenal, 4 in manuel antonio and 4 in dominical.

were expecting to pay about 40$ a day for food, but i wonder if this is too little. we would ofcourse want to be able to spend on fruits and other treats outside of our 3 meals a day, without having to break the budget.

we also saw that national parks typically charge around 25-40$ for entry, + 5$ for the parking. we want to see a cloud forest in monteverde, the arenal np, manuel antonio np, a coffee/cocoa tour and as many waterfalls as we can see/afford.

finally, for the last week in manuel antonio/dominical, we'd like to spend most of the week at the beach surfing. we saw that a board rental for a week should be about 150$, but the prices likely vary and this may be for the cheaper/extremely used boards.

&#x200b;

any thoughts? does this budget seem roughly accurate? if you know prices in usd, we use a 1.34 exchange rate to be on the safer side.

as an aside, the 128$ arsenal vs chelsea charge is unrelated to costa_rica, were catching the game on the return trip back home.

Two things to know before arriving at the airport,"hi guys, i just wanted to inform you about two bad stories that happened to me this week. 
1) items got stolen from my backpack (checked luggage) when i picked it up after arriving. the thief opened a pocket on the top and used a knife to access a little pocket. one ring, one watch and one bracelet got stolen. it happens when you travel, but i‚Äôve traveled all over the world for 15 years and this is the first time that happens to me.
2) i booked a 4x4 in advance before on internet (edreams) + a car insurance on the same site. but when i arrived at avis (airport), the staff told me i had no choice but to buy a new insurance (around 400$) even if i told him i already had an insurance bought online and with my credit card. is it a scam? is there a local law that says we need to pay for a local insurance plan and that insurance paid online before is useless?

Andaz Papagayo,"after reading many positive reviews of andaz papagayo, my partner and i were so excited to spend our vacation there. however we did not enjoy the resort as much as some others. 

we had some odd interactions. an example of an odd interaction is when we checked in, the staff member was showing us a map and we asked about the different beaches. he stated that the map was ‚Äúmistaken‚Äù in naming two beaches (implying it was a typo) but when we walked around the resort there were two distinct beaches (in opposite directions like the map). i‚Äôm not sure why he implied differently?

we then had an interaction where the wrong drinks were delivered to us, which we only realized after taking a sip, and then it appeared the staff may have re-served the drinks we sipped to another couple. 

later, the front desk staff said they would call us a golf cart when we checked out but didn‚Äôt follow through, which had also happened with two staff members who earlier in the trip said they would help us with an issue with the coffee machine but then never circled back.

also for couples traveling, the ‚Äúadult only‚Äù pools often had children and the  beach was not as large or swimmable as one might expect - though they were beautiful. 

lastly, it felt like everything had a cost or fee or staff was trying to upsell which really made it less of a pleasant experience as compared to the previous resort we stayed at (nayara). 

all in all, i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this resort based on our experience (jan 2022). it was fine but definitely not worth the price.",1,279

i am moving to san_jose in january - and will try to golf quite a bit. i have boiled it down to valle del sol or cariari - at least from what i can find on the map. unfortunately there is not many pictures of the training areas - and i was wondering which one has the best facilities for driving range and short game practice. 

i also read that people could buy greenfees to a reduced price trough some app - and was wondering what the best way is to sign up for membership. as i am trying to keep the cost as low as possible. 

i prefer playing long holes where i can drive - but have understood that this is not that common in costa_rica, unfortunatly i have to stay in san_jose area - so would be something around that spot. 

please share your experience or other good tips you have with me, and if you play in costa_rica - let me know - and i am down to play and meet some new friends. i have a 20hcp so no pro, but want to get better as every golfer do.

1. i am leaving samara this weekend and am looking for a good spot to head to until tuesday night, when i have to head to the airport to pick up a friend. where should i go?? i love hiking and would love to do a more intense hike if i could find a safe place, maybe with a guide. otherwise, might just hit tamarindo for a couple of days (i‚Äôve never been)
2. my friend is here in cr for 5 days. i am hoping to hit: monteverde and la_fortuna to do cloud forest, lake arenal, hot springs, night jungle tour, and zip lining. how long do you think we will need for all of that! we are young and able-bodies, so don‚Äôt mind pushing ourselves a bit to squeeze it all inü§™also hoping to show her around a beachy place for a day or so. i‚Äôve been on the pacific side, but maybe thinking of going to the caribbean. any suggestions? is puerto-viejo worth it? 
thank you!!",1,190

i'm sure the latter exists, but is there a specific city i should bee-line to upon arrival to find what i'm looking for? most of the cities i've had friends recommend seem to fall into the category of activities i'd rather avoid.

well those are regional airports even though limon is technically international it only hosts small planes coming from panama or nicaragua 

if you want to book a flight to my country it‚Äôs either juan santamaria international which is my recommendation to visit anything in either the gam lower and to the east. or you can opt for daniel oduber airport in liberia to go to the northwest part of the nation (talking guanacaste and alajuela)

Thinking of Moving my family - Try to convince me Not to,"was advised to crosspost here:

 my wife and i are contemplating a move out of the us, and think cr is a great option. we're both college educated, and think we can find enough online work to tide us over until our residency finalizes. we're very ok with stripping our lifestyle down to fit into the tico lifestyle (like seriously my kilt, a boonie cap, and some sandals and i'm a happy man.) and we *will have enough cash from selling our house here in the states to be able to get us over the hump of residency requirements and put a down payment on a permaculture style chunk of land.

i need you all to talk me out of this if you can. i'm very pragmatic, but if the negatives of this move don't outweigh the positives, then we may be on our way.

my (our) goal is to set up a regenerative ag style property with fitting animals and enough fruit/veg production to to pay the bills. i know things are different down there from what we're used to. but i know there is a lot of latitude given for trying to be as eco-minded as possible.

i'm a vet who's been to a lot of different places, so ""different than suburban america"" is actually a huge positive for me.

how's the night life now? last year everything closed early (like 10 or 11?) where before covid i found i could stay out until 2.

Watching World Cup at Tabacon Hot Springs,"hi all.

we will be staying at la_fortuna in late nov  and will be spending a day at tabacon hot springs. that exact day canada will be playing their first world cup game since forever against belgium. being a football fan from canada, i definitely don't want to miss that game.

i've called tabacon, and they told me there are no tvs in common areas (restaurant, lobby). there are tvs in rooms only (we aren't staying there).

so my options are:

\- miss a game (i don't like that, but my wife does :))

\- stream it on my phone/tablet. is there wifi with good internet or is the cell signal strong enough for that?

\- go out of the resort and look for a tv somewhere near. will probably not going to do that unless there is something really close. is there any place nearby with a tv?

\- watch a replay in the evening in my hotel room. not sure how i can do that. which local channel will be showing world cup? do they have some sort of online on demand features?

\- meet someone who will be watching the game while staying at the resort, watch it with them in their hotel room. that might be wierd, but it's world cup, so who cares.

\- costa_rica will be playing spain that same day, so maybe tabacon will set up some tv somewhere.

Another first timers itinerary check,"we've spent the day looking around and trying to come up with a decent itinerary for our first time visit to costa_rica.  we're flying into liberia on the 19th and out on the 2nd nov.  we want to do a little bit of everything and plan on renting a car for the trip.  so far, we've got this:

1. 19th oct - liberia - la_fortuna
2. 23rd oct - la_fortuna - manuel antonio
3. 25th oct - manual antonio - monteverde
4. 27th oct - monteverde - samara
5. 1st nov - samara - liberia

i'd prefer to get back to liberia the night before, just in case anything happens on the day.

when i say we want to do a little bit of everything:

* la_fortuna we're going to want to see and enjoy the hot springs, visit arenal and do a hike or two, do some rafting, waterfall and chocolate tour.
* manuel antonio, reviews on this sub seem a bit mixed as to whether it's worth going or not but in general i think we'd enjoy a visit to the national park and seeing the wild life there
* monteverde for the cloud forests
* samara, for learning to surf (never done before), seeing the turtles (though we might be too late for that?), snorkelling or maybe a dive (we're both padi certified).  do wonder if we're staying too long there, but with a car i guess we could maybe travel down to montezuma.  might it be better to base ourselves in manual antonio and travel to uvita or dominical and spend longer there than in samara?

i guess a big problem is that it's still very much rainy season which might mean things like rafting will be closed?",1,296
Opinions on renting a car vs private transportation to get around the island,"i will be going to costa_rica for 10 days near the end of october. i will be traveling with my significant other. we plan on arriving in liberia, traveling to la_fortuna for 5 days. after that we will travel to manuel antonio for 4 nights. then travel to san juan for the last night where we will be flying out. 

i like the idea of having the freedom to drive and visit wherever i want when i want, which would be the major plus of renting a car. the downside is the price, 900+, along with having to worry about driving and the safety of the car.

where as if i was to do a private shuttle, it appears to be less expensive, i wouldn't have to stress about driving in a foreign country, and it seems many of the tours would provide transportation included in their packages. 

so i'm curious about your opinions and experiences of the pros and cons of both renting a car vs private transportation?",1,171

Critique My Trip,"planning on going sometime at the end of may (shoulder season/early rainy season). here are the plans so far:

fly into sjo late and stay one night->leave next morning->2 days/nights in la_fortuna->3 days/nights in monteverde->1.5 days in guanacaste region, visit playa del coco, lounge->leave from lir

activities we plan on doing: hiking, canopy walks (monteverde), night jungle tour, coffee tour (monteverde)

we enjoy hiking and the jungle environment more than the beach hence the short time there. read that monteverde has more hiking than la_fortuna but open to suggestions if people know different. we also don't want to spend a lot of time traveling towards the end and playa del coco was the closest beach to the liberia area.  we are still trying to figure out accommodations so any suggestions welcome (budget-midrange prices ideally).

6 week trip in Costa Rica review,"hello costa_rica travellers,

i have just come back from a 6 week trip around cr. i really enjoyed my time. some places were amazing other places so so.

i travelled to san_jose, puerto viejo, cahuita, tortuguero, osa peninsula, domincal, uvita, quepos, rivas, monteverde, la_fortuna.

first i will say the osa peninsula was my favorite place of the whole trip. we stayed in a hostel which bordered the corcavado park. to get the hostel you have to hike 30 minutes up some steep trails. the place is called bolita and i would encourage anyone heading to cr thats interested in nature to go here for the real authentic experience.

my least favourite was monteverde and la_fortuna both are expensive and touristy, if you want to visit the real cr do not go here. la_fortuna is much prettier then monteverde but it is still way too touristy. the cloud forest in monteverde is 26 dollars and it can be quite windy and rainy even in the dry season, the weather in la_fortuna is better. if you really want to go one of these places go to la_fortuna.

if you want to visit a cloud forest other then monteverde look into san gerardo de rivas.

uvita and manuel antonio had the most beautiful beaches. even though ma is super touristy its worth the 16 dollars fee, the beaches are lovely but don't expect to see much wildlife other then white face monkeys.

the caribbean side is much less developed and not as well taken care of compared to the pacific coast but the caribbean side is very beautiful and so rich with wildlife. if staying in pv try to stay outside of the town or cahuita. pv itself is somewhat dirty with an issue with rubbish and gangs of young guys trying to hussle you to buy coke or weed. but it is quite beautiful.

tortuguero is a really beautiful place that is a little bit hard to get to but worth the trek. we travelled using public transport for the whole trip except to get to tortuguero from pv. we used a shuttle which was 40 dollars with breakfast included, we left tortuguero by public water taxi and public bus, both easy to access.

we enjoyed our time in cr. it was more expensive then we thought. buses and accommodation was fairly inexpensive but everything else food, beer, toiletries are quite expensive.",1,407
Eating freshly cut and raw fruit,"hi all,

i have read the fruit is amazing in costa_rica. i generally have a very weak american stomach and worry about getting sick from eating freshly cut or raw fruit. (we‚Äôre planning on doing bottled water).

for those who have weaker stomachs, did you enjoy freshly cut fruit and raw fruit? i would hate to miss out on all costa_rica has to offer and would greatly appreciate any appreciate insight. we will be in touristy areas of manuel antonio and guanacaste if that factors into calculus.

Travel with long covid symptoms- very interesting,"so i was exposed to/had covid in march 2020. it was nbd, i had breathing issues that were annoying and stomach issues and that was all. however, it left me with long covid (i believe).. i had severe dizziness and vertigo which basically altered my life immensely. i did go into pt and that helped quite a bit, i religiously learned the [epley maneuver](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/home-epley-maneuver) and i was pretty good -i could go for about 7 hours without having to do this procedure, and the pt taught me how to be aware while also being dizzy to avoid injury. it was not perfect but it was manageable.

i was very reluctant, when asked by my daughter, to travel anywhere. more because i did not want to be a bummer in any way. she needed a vacation and her happy spot has become cr.  of course, she convinced me to go (10/22)

we went to la_fortuna, and i did my little epley every 7 hours, morning and before dinner.. and then we went on to guanacaste. 

in general, the pura vida is a real thing. and i began to breath very deeply in la_fortuna. the air feeling cleaner than i have ever experienced before (in rainforest ). 

guanacaste the experience continued, but it was heightened - whatever breathing limitations i have had all my life (that i frankly was not aware i had at all, i guess it‚Äôs just city living ) were completely gone. and one night (kinda drunk ) i fell asleep outside on the porch, decided out of laziness and tranquility to stay, watched the sun come up, watched animals scurry here and there (over the porch :), listened to the waves in the distance lapping onto the shore- and just cherished the breathing. i really was at peace.

and then i went about my day, the rest of the vacation,  back to work - without even noticing that my vertigo and dizziness were completely gone. that epley was not at all necessary, that exercise and movement were not restricted at all. 

i am wondering (and i definitely believe it to be the case, i will not be convinced otherwise), that the extra oxygen i received in cr, and especially as i slept outside that evening, gave me my life back. 

anyway, end of story. love you cr, for the people, animals, country- pura vida is real.",1,400

LGBTQ+ Acceptance,"we will be traveling in april and traveling around from a ""home base"" in cuidad colon and playa garza (just outside san juan and in guanacaste respectively) with an lgbtq+ teen.  he is open and typically wears a pride bracelet or a necklace and sometimes a t-shirt or similar.  not super ""in your face"" or anything but he doesn't hide it nor am i comfortable with telling him to.  while i am loathe to push him into a closet, i am even more concerned with his safety.  i love costa_rica and the culture so would be surprised if they are aren't accepting but this isn't something i have had to really deal with in my past travels there as this is the first time i am bringing my kids.  

what are the attitudes toward the lgbtq+ community and are there any things or places i should be aware of for his safety?  like i said, he isn't decked out head to toe in rainbows or anything like that.  i am not overly concerned but his mother (my exwife) did ask and i want to make sure she is comfortable as well.  thank you in advance for any help!",1,199
Nervous to go to CR for a month and want to feel excited again.

i would love to hear your best cr stories to know that i made the right choice to go.

Having a rough time in Costa Rica and just need someone to tell me it‚Äôll be ok,"
i was supposed to go here to work and invited my family to come for the first 2 weeks, but my brother got sick with covid last minute and since he is a kid my dad decided to stay with him. my mom and i went. 
we arrived yesterday and honestly so much went wrong yesterday. i bought an esim card in advance so i had data soon as we were in cr. bought it from highly recommended airalo. didn‚Äôt work, im still trying to figure out why with them and get my refund. they just keep telling me to take the same steps i already did a million times over.

so couldn‚Äôt catch an uber at the airport even though i‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs easy to do. took an overpriced taxi to our hotel in san_jose that we were staying at for 1 night since it was 12am and i couldn‚Äôt deal with it. the next day we went to get the car we originally booked for the 4 of us to go to our airbnb at playa hermosa near jaco. got slapped with $1200 price instead of our original $500 bc of insurance etc. i kinda had a feeling this was going to happen but my dad was the one who booked it so by the time i realized we didn‚Äôt really have other options. but i also didn‚Äôt expect the price difference being that much. the lady at the rental place was nice tho and called us a taxi to go to hermosa. the driver was also really nice and stopped at a bank to get cash. we couldn‚Äôt get cash through any of our cards and tried multiple times, finally it worked. we were half way to jaco when there was a huge accident so we had to go back an around. i get motion sickness so i was miserable going up and down the mountains. when we finally arrive here we realized how isolated we are, which was the point of it since we were supposed to have a car with us (wanted a quiet area). 

the icing on the cake is that i check one of my cards i tried at the atm and see a charge for the cash i never got from it and i can‚Äôt call my card support number because my esim is still not working. i tried emailing them but they need call me for privacy reasons. 

anyways had sad tomatoes and unseasoned pasta for dinner cause that was the only thing we found at a market 1 km away. 

just annoyed, sad and exhausted and trapped in this airbnb.

tldr: had a rough start to my trip, waisted lots of money i wasn‚Äôt planning to  and having a rough time in costa_rica

edit: thanks for everyone‚Äôs support! i‚Äôm slowly starting to appreciate the trip more. we decided not to rent a car cause we are not confident in our driving abilities here. we will try booking some tours with pick up and drop off for the weekend. just taking it one thing at a time. uber works ok here actually, we took it to jaco and back yesterday to get groceries. the hermosa beach is gorgeous! the data plan worked after extensive troubleshooting, they told me to connect to wrong carrier in the first place‚Ä¶personally i wouldn‚Äôt use them again, i had to tweet at them to get any response and escalate it. i am here for a month for those who are asking, my next stop after this is manuel antonio!",1,596

CR in June: looking for help with itinerary and other things,"hello! i've wanted to visit costa_rica for a long time and now i'm finally going in june. i'll be there for almost three weeks and i don't know much yet, so i hope you can  help me plan my trip.

the \[very loose\]  plan so far is to rent a car and travel to some different spots for the first week or two, then do workaway (working in exchange for food and accommodation) somewhere nice.

in general, i don't want to spend a ton of money on accommodation and food, and i'd prefer to avoid places that are too overcrowded by tourists. but i'm sure there are some absolute must-sees and must-dos; just finding a good balance between that and a more unique/authentic experience would be cool.

some questions:

1. places to visit?
2. car/terrain: i've heard roads in cr can be pretty unwelcoming, so what kind of car do you recommend that i rent? 4x4 drive? specific rental companies you recommend?
3. how do i know where i'm allowed to camp in cr?
4. any options for meeting natives living in more traditional ways, maybe staying with them for a few days?
5. considering what i've written above, for how long would you recommend i travel around before settling down to do workaway?
6. what are some traditional costa_rican dishes?
7. spanish phrases/words specific to costa_rica?
8. my spanish has gotten rusty so i think it could help to start watching some movies in spanish, and they might as well be from costa_rica. any good movies to recommend?

Ride from SJO to Tamarindo on the 28th,"hello, two of my friends and i arrive at sjo tomorrow (december 28th) at about 3:30pm local time. we have a hostel booked for that night in tamarindo but are unsure of how we‚Äôll get there. the public/shared shuttles all are done leaving sjo by that time so i was wondering if anyone had any alternatives before we spend $300 on an uber.

Quepos and Drake Bay Trip,"were doing a 10 day trip to cr and going to to stay in quepos and drake bay. planning on doing fishing, snorkeling and some wildlife in both places. right now for wildlife we are planning on doing 1 day tour and 1 night tour in manuel antonio and 1 day and 1 night tour in drake bay. 

from the research it appears drake bay/osa peninsula is the best place for wildlife in the country. because of this i'm thinking is it better to do no day trips in ma and take 2 days for wildlife (not sure if it would be better to do two different day trips or an overnight) in drake bay where there is the best wildlife?

i will add going with some older relatives that would probably struggle with long intense hikes, hopefully we can find easier hikes with good wildlife.

Trip Ideas,"hi all! 

i'm doing some last minute trip planning for a costa_rica trip with my husband next week. don't even know where to start! we will be in the country for 8 days. hoping for some good recommendations as to what areas to focus on and good activities. our flights are into and out of san_jose, but we're thinking we will just rent a car for the 8 days since rental cars look super cheap. we're on a somewhat tight budget, so not trying to do anything too luxurious and touristy. we like living more like locals. we both speak decent spanish. the few activities we are most interested in would be seeing some coffee farms / coffee tastings, and maybe one day of whitewater rafting if not too expensive. other than that, we just want to enjoy the beautiful scenery, hang out at the beach, and eat lots of tacos. 

also, we are 2 gay males, early 30s, so wanting to also make sure we stay in areas that are safe and welcoming (which seems to include most of costa_rica, but you never know). and lastly, we have about a million hilton rewards points we've saved from business travelling, so we can get our rooms covered by hilton points if we want. we much prefer airbnbs and hostels to meet people and get a more authentic experience, but we're willing to do some nights in a hilton too to save money. thanks so much in advance for any tips anyone might have! we really need a travel agent to just plan things for us, but i figured reddit might be the next best thing!

14 Days Exploring Central Costa Rica -- Advice on Itinerary?,"my partner and i are going to costa_rica fore 14 days in february. very excited as it will be my first time there and they haven't been there since they were a child. 

we are really into hiking, are beginner surfers, and are super stoked on seeing some wildlife. we plan on renting a car so we can have more freedom to explore (and we are willing to spend extra to get something with high clearance and 4-wheel drive if that is possible). that all said, hoping to get some feedback on this planned itinerary. if this doesn't work out, we will check out the northwest part of the country (monteverde, playa grande, samara, etc..)

&#x200b;

day 1 - fly into san jos√© and stay the night nearby

day 2 - drive to san gerardo de rivas (spend 2 or 3 nights here)

day 3 - hike around san gerardo de rivas

day 4 - drive to san gerardo de dota (spend 2 or 3 nights here)

day 5 - hike around san gerardo de dota

day 6  - hike around san gerardo de dota

day 7 - drive to dominica/utiva (spend 3 nights here) 

day 8 - beach and ocean stuff at dominica/utiva 

day 9 - beach and ocean stuff at dominica/utiva 

day 10 - drive half way to la_fortuna (need to do research/get recs here, ideally we'd stay near the coast)

day 11 - drive to la_fortuna (spend 2 nights here at a springs resort)

day 12 - la_fortuna springs resort

day 13 - drive to san jos√© and check out the city

day 14 - fly out of san jos√©

&#x200b;

some questions we are still working out:

* how dangerous are the roads to san gerardo de rivas and san gerardo de dota? my partner has driven in challenging conditions before but we also don't want to start off the trip with an impossible journey.
* are we spending too long at san gerardo de dota and san gerardo de rivas? should we spend more time in one over the other? 
* recommendations for half way between la_fortuna and dominica? 
* we've read that manual antonio is going to be super crowded cause it is peak season, is it worth incorporating a trip to the national park? we'd probably cut time at  san gerardo de rivas and san gerardo de dota to do so.

Honeymoon suggestions,"my fiance and i will be honeymooning to cr in january 2023. i've been reading through a lot of blogs/forums for information, but would love some input from you guys. we're either gonna go for 10 or 12 days (i'm pushing for 12). we're for sure going to la_fortuna & monteverde, but i'm trying to decide where to go for the 3rd city (or 4th if you recommend it). i've been looking into the guanacaste province (leaning towards this one) vs uvita. i was reading some great reviews on playa flamingo and considering this area. we will be flying from the us so most flights i've seen have us arriving midday and could still enjoy half a day outside. 

my questions: 

1. if we traveled there for 2 weeks, would going to all 4 locations be too much or should we just stick to 3? i've read uvita is like a 5-6 hr drive from la_fortuna so that would almost consume entire day driving. 
2. if i just go to 3 locations, should i split it up 4 days in each location or less time in one area/more in another?
3. if we go to the guanacasta area, what part would you recommend?
4. we like to walk/hike and plan to get off the beaten path a couple of days. i think we're also gonna do the 1968 trail. do we need hiking boots or would some athletic shoes be serviceable?

i'm traveling solo, female, not interested in partying, more into good surf, you, food, tours. i've seen so much great info on this thread but putting it out there if anyone wants to post suggestions :)

also new to hostel scene so a bit hesitant and would love advice.

thank you!!!",1,166

Stop-offs/sights on drive from Samara to Monteverde?," we are visiting cr in two weeks from the u.k. and we are incredibly excited! i think most of our itinerary is ironed out, apart from the day we drive from samara beach to monteverde. we plan to follow the shorter (?) route which passes nicoya and follows route 18 over tempisque river.

does anyone have any recommendations on places we should stop and see along the way?  

it's still a fairly long drive so it would be nice to break it up with some sights and we, of course, don't want to miss anything notable! it looks like there will be some amazing views on the way but we wanted to check we wouldn't be driving past anything in ignorance! i had originally planned to visit palo verde en route, until i realised this was actually quite out of the way!

any help would be great! thanks",1,148
"Where‚Äôs the surf, bruh?ü§ôüèª","hey hey there fellow costa travelers! i need some help with my trip to costa_rica next month. 

my boyfriend and i usually stay in tamarindo when we visit cr. we both enjoy the fun surf vibes of the town. 

however, we were invited on a trip to papagayo peninsula in mid may. we both have never been to that part of the country, so super pumped for the opportunity to see some new parts of cr. 

we want to stay a few extra days and venture out past the peninsula. we are looking at playa hermosa, guanacaste province. i don‚Äôt think we want to taxi all the way to tamarindo (1.5 hour drive). 

so, what kind of experiences have people had in playa hermosa? what kind of vibes does it have? any surfing?

does anyone have any recommendations for fun surf towns between papagayo peninsula and tamarindo? we will be doing a lot of snorkeling, boat rides, and sightseeing in papagayo. so we just want to chill, surf, eat/drink the second part of the trip. 

thanks! and always, pura vidaü§ôüèª",1,181
Considering dropping my vehicle rental and relying on public transit...good or bad move?,"i'm landing in sj on april 9th and am heading to montezuma for my first few nights. the vehicle is booked and i can grab it right near the airport....but here are my concerns:

-i booked last minute (last week) and there wasn't much left. so naturally prices are on the high-end. it's reserved for just over 1800$ canadian(for 12 days) and that's not counting whatever insurance they'll impose on me

-the company: economy rent-a-car. seeing nothing but horrid reviews online about them, from charging an absurd amount for mandatory insurance to just not even having vehicles in stock when they were reserved months in advance.

-semana santa. i overlooked this part when i started planning this trip with the intention of ''winging it''. it's my understanding that the roads will be somewhat chaotic. how bad would the drive from sj to montezuma be on the 9th (saturday)? i imagine alot of people will have began their vacation that weekend. be it by ferry or the land route.

wondering just how much freedom i'll be giving up my dropping my rental and relying on public transit. i realize i'll get stuck in traffic just as much but atleast i wouldnt be stressing out about driving alone. luckily i don't have to pay for the vehicle until i show up, so it leaves me time to pivot. my main goal was having the freedom to explore nooks and crannies along the way, but maybe that 'freedom' isnt worth the price of rental when i could save so much using buses/shuttles. also hoping to do tamarindo, monteverde and arenal afterwards.

any thoughts or advice are appreciated, thanks.",1,275

Will rain ruin our November honeymoon?,"we are currently planning our honeymoon for november of this year, and have picked up an incredible amount of insight from many of the folks on here! we are super excited to visit costa_rica (having never been) and are still finalizing our itinerary with specifics. flights, however, have been booked and we have put together a general plan for the 12 days we will be there.

11/6-8 - fly in to liberia, drive to nicoya peninsula and stay somewhere relaxing tbd  
11/9-11 - montezuma/santa teresa  
11/12-14 - monteverde  
11/15-17 - la_fortuna  
11/18 - drive from la_fortuna to liberia and fly home

knowing that november is the end of the rainy season, we're expecting some rain here and there but hoping to gather insight on how much this could impact our trip. should we be expecting short, but heavy rainfall daily (during which we can relax inside for a short period of time)? or should we expect more extended rain/storms that can take out most of the day, with most of our activities throughout the trip being impacted? or with november being the ""end"" of the rainy season, will it already be tapering off with just some showers here and there that we can happily have fun in?

any insight is appreciated as we continue to plan and potentially pivot if it seems the trip will be thrown off due to the rain - thank you!",1,238

"10 Days in Costa Rica: La Fortuna, Monteverde, Manuel Antonio, Alajuela - My experience","**trip report 6/25 to 7/4**

when my wife and i started planning to go to costa_rica, i found that reading [other people‚Äôs trip reviews on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/elpf0m/trip_report_costa_rica_nov_1826_2019_arenalla/) was the most helpful way to help us plan our vacation. so, i would be remiss if i didn‚Äôt try to do the same. hopefully this will be useful to you!

deciding on where to go was the hardest part. we quickly honed in on la_fortuna, monteverde, and manuel antonio for our trip to the cr. it‚Äôs the obvious tourist route and typical choice for first timers ‚Äî and for good reason. it showcases some of the best of the country. guanacaste is also highly recommended, but since we only had about 9 days, didn‚Äôt surf, and already live near the beach, we decided to skip it. 

**6/25:** lax -> sjo, we took the red-eye which got us into san_jose about 6:30am. hate overnight flights, but it made the most sense and we didn‚Äôt lose a day to travel. 

**6/26:** arriving in sjo was a breeze. there was basically nobody at the airport and we had all of our paperwork in order. we filled out the health pass the day before and had our qr codes ready. we also used [trawick](https://www.trawickinternational.com/travel-insurance-plans/costa-rica-required-travel-insurance) for travel insurance and had no issues.

**sim card:**  i got a claro sim in the airport, mostly for convenience. some say kolbi and movistar are better, but from what i gleaned, i think it really depends on where you are. i bought the 10,000 colones tourist package. it worked fine, no complaints.

**car rental:** after collecting our bags, we were met outside by the rep from [vamos](https://vamosrentacar.com/). they are easily the most recommended car rental agency here because they are very honest and upfront about their prices and insurance costs and after reading lots of horror stories about hidden fees/scams, they were a breath of fresh air. we were able to purchase the base level insurance and use our credit card insurance (you have to get a letter from your cc company) to cover the rest.

we rented a 4x4 and let me tell you right now to ignore anyone who says you don‚Äôt need a 4x4 in costa_rica. *yes*, most of the roads are paved (though still beat to shit and full of potholes) and, *yes*, there are plenty of locals driving around in sedans‚Ä¶ but if you make one wrong turn (our gps loved to send us down wrong turns and roads that didn‚Äôt exist) you will be glad you have a 4x4. i highly recommend paying a few extra bucks a day and getting a 4x4. regarding the gps, some people recommend waze over google maps, we used both and saw no difference ‚Äî ymmv.

our overall experience with vamos was good, i just have two complaints. first, the car was beat to shit and smelled like mildew. to be fair, it was the last car available (they were fully booked) and the rep was great about making sure to note all the pre-existing damage (though i still took a video). a can of lysol solved the latter issue. second, in order to get the car, they made us sign a blank form accepting responsibility for anything that wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance. meaning: they could fill it in later describing any incident and would have a ‚Äúsigned‚Äù document of me accepting responsibility. i‚Äôm sure they just do it to cover their ass, but the way the guy tried to hide the document and make me sign the bottom put a bad taste in my mouth. they knew they were doing some shady shit. nothing came of it, but it cast a pall over my rental experience.

car in hand, we stopped at *delicias* in alajuela and had a very nice breakfast. our plan was to drive to la_fortuna, but since we couldn‚Äôt check in to our hotel til 3pm and having no other plans, we had decided to take our time and make a few stops along the way:

**doka coffee estate:** if you are in costa_rica, you have to do at least one coffee tour. i can‚Äôt speak to others, but doka was really great. they are about 20 minutes outside of alajuela. we showed up for the 10am tour and basically [had it to ourselves](https://i.postimg.cc/rzy32n0w/20210626-093912.jpg). our guide was great and we learned a lot about making coffee and even bought a few bags to take home. definitely recommend.

**catarata del toro:** most people suggest la paz waterfall is a good place to stop along the way from san_jose to la_fortuna, and they may be right, but we decided to go a little off the beaten path and try toro instead. it‚Äôs less busy and cheaper. i must say, even in the pouring rain, it was [stunning](https://postimg.cc/wrbswy5d). it‚Äôs a bit of a hike down and back up again (get used to that if you want to see waterfalls here). protip: if your gps tries to take you down some insane road, ignore it. stay on the main road.

we arrived in arenal about 4pm to our hotel: **arenal volcano inn**. it was nice, well-located, and fairly priced. not to mention each room has an [incredible view of arenal](https://postimg.cc/zhrqxq89). we stayed 3 nights and would recommend it. after checking in, we had dinner at *tierra mia*, one of the better meals we had in la_fortuna. exhausted, we called it an early night.

**6/27:** probably our best day in costa_rica. we had booked the [whitewater rafting / rappel combo with wave rafting](https://www.waveexpeditions.com/product/rafting-waterfall-rappelling-adventure-combo/). another company handled the rappelling part of the tour, but wave coordinated everything. rappelling down waterfalls was a blast and we felt incredibly safe the whole time. we finished that around 11am and moved on to the whitewater rafting tour. also amazing. our guide was super nice and made sure to pair us with other english speakers. he also pointed out wildlife and told us lots of great stories. i expected the rafting section to be brief, but to my surprise we were on the water for almost 3 hours! it was a blast! great for families too, while the water was rough, the guides were great and there were lots of families on the tour. ended with a great meal and shot of sugarcane liquor.

after walking around town and a couples massage at a local spa, we went to **tabacon hot springs** for our evening pass and dinner. tabacon is the most expensive/‚Äùfancy‚Äù hot spring in town, and while it was very nice‚Ä¶ i wasn‚Äôt that impressed. we didn‚Äôt visit any other hot springs, so i have no frame of reference, but for the cost‚Ä¶ i wish we had. the main ‚Äúriver‚Äù runs directly from the spring and is great to relax in (bring water shoes, it‚Äôs rocky) but the other pools were limited. and to top it all off, the dinner was awful and the drinks weren‚Äôt very strong. we left early.  ‚Öó stars.

**6/28:** after a great breakfast at *ar√°bigos coffee house*, we went to the **bogarin trail** private reserve. it wasn‚Äôt until the end of our trip did we truly realize how great this place was. we saw more wildlife in this small reserve than we would see in all the national parks we would later visit combined. we stood an [arm's-length from a sloth](https://postimg.cc/d8hbgzsb), saw poison dart frogs, howler monkeys, the jesus-christ lizard, and a plethora of other flora and fauna. not to mention they only do small tour groups to enhance the experience. do not miss this place!

had lunch at *soda viquez* and had the typical ‚Äúcasado‚Äù before going to‚Ä¶

 **rainforest chocolate tour:** chocolate is synonymous with coffee in cr, so we had to do a tour. again, being the only people there, the tour was private. while it was interesting, they aren‚Äôt a working chocolate farm and the tour itself is limited and focused more on how the indigenous used to make chocolate. it was fine, but i would recommend finding a different tour.

**catarata r√≠o fortuna:** we *almost* skipped this waterfall, since we still planned to see several more elsewhere, and i‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt. [it was beautiful](https://postimg.cc/vccvfnzs). while crowded (allegedly it‚Äôs better early in the day) it‚Äôs one of the few you can swim in. see it if you have time. again, be prepared for lots of stairs.

dinner at *spectacolar*, nothing to write home about. our last night in la_fortuna.

**6/29:** breakfast at *red frog coffee roasters*, one of our best breakfasts to be sure before heading out to monteverde. we stopped at **rio celeste waterfall** on the way. maybe an hour detour, but worth it. there is no shortage of waterfalls in cr, but this one is unique because of the [bright blue water](https://postimg.cc/bsds0x8t). a worthwhile stop if heading from la_fortuna to monteverde. we also stopped at the [free swimming area](https://postimg.cc/vcmkmqyf) a few minutes down the road to cool off afterward.

lunch at *la choza del maiz*, decent, but i was starting to grow weary of the casado. one can only eat so many rice, beans, and chicken. [we did fall in love with a friendly stray while there](https://postimg.cc/pp4rpbjc).

after once again being led astray by our gps and losing another hour (though a beautiful drive), we eventually arrived at monteverde and the *hotel belmar*, easily our favorite hotel from this trip. we didn‚Äôt know this when booking it, but they have their own farm and all their food is farm to table. had dinner at the hotel and it would have been our favorite meal, were it not for the meal we would have the next night.

**6/30**: early morning coffee and pastry at cafe monteverde coffee shop, more for convenience, the food and coffee were not great, the off to **selvatura adventure park** for ziplining and the hanging bridges. we opted to not do the other activities at the park and were more than happy. the ziplining and tarzan swing are a blast and always felt safe! the hanging bridges made for a beautiful walk afterward. i hear the other ziplining place is equally as good, but i definitely recommend selvatura.

lunch at *choco cafe* was great, get the brownie for dessert. it‚Äôs what they are known for.

now, some people may scoff at this‚Ä¶ but we started to run into this problem in monteverde where we were running out of things to do. there is a lot of crossover of activities with la_fortuna and monteverde. by doing a lot in la_fortuna, we had less to do in monteverde. in retrospect, i wish we had spent one less day in fortuna and done those things in mv. unless you are really into birdwatching, there is less to do in mv. the only thing we didn't do that was highly recommended was the night tours. but from what we heard, it's mostly bugs, frogs, and snakes... not our kind of thing. we spent the rest of the day exploring the town before grabbing a pizza (don‚Äôt judge) and calling it a night.

**7/1**: we booked a tour in the **monteverde cloud forest preserve** with **three brothers tours**.  our tour guide really was trying his best, but there just wasn‚Äôt a lot to see. though we did see the most famous resplendent quetzal despite it not being their nesting season. nevertheless, we learned a lot and later hiked to the continental divide. i must say, [monteverde was one the most beautiful places i have ever visited](https://postimg.cc/dks71kxg).  protip: if you go early enough, you don‚Äôt need to park at the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù parking and you can park for free right outside the entrance ‚Äî ymmv. you will notice this trend of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù parking in cr that is just getting tourists to pay to park.

lunch at the *green restaurant* before another lazy afternoon. however, we decided to splurge a bit and had dinner at **san lucas treetop experience**. it was the by far the **best meal** we had in cr. you are literally eating an incredible 7-course meal suspended in a glass box among the treetops. nuff said. hurry and go before they get their michelin star and it becomes impossible and even more expensive. $100 person, $50 more if you want the wine pairing ‚Äî which we did. 5 stars.

**7/2:** after a [great breakfast](https://postimg.cc/tkb5hxbn) at *orchid coffee*, we left monteverde for manuel antonio. we stopped at the crocodile bridge for a smoothie and to take in the [prehistoric beasts](https://postimg.cc/z0jq0gcq). a nice stop, make sure to tip the parking attendants. we stopped for lunch in jaco, but the vibe was that it was party town and we didn‚Äôt linger long. 

eventually, we arrived at our hotel in manuel antonio: the **parador resort**. very nice, but a typical resort experience. there was a ton of wildlife on the grounds, and we saw capuchin monkeys, macaus(?), and a sloth. we stayed for two nights.

dinner at *cafe milagro* was great.

**7/3:** we went to **manuel antonio national park** after breakfast at the hotel. again, be wary of parking scammers. there will be guys who literally walk out into the road to try and stop you from going further. don‚Äôt stop unless you like walking for miles. you will eventually have to stop and pay for parking (expect to pay the *gringo price* if you don't speak spanish) but try to park as close to the park entrance as possible. 

[the park itself was beautiful](https://postimg.cc/lhyymjwk). bring your swimsuit and enjoy the water. we did the unthinkable ‚Äî *according to conventional advice* ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt hire a guide. we already had seen so much wildlife and learned so much from our previous tours that we probably could have led a tour ourselves. besides, there are so many tour groups stopping and pointing things out, you will see all that there is to see.

after the park, we took a drive down to [dominical](https://postimg.cc/w1nf5zjg) and took a surf lesson at **costa_rica surf camp**. our teacher was funny and extremely patient, especially with me who only managed to stand once (cut me some slack, it was my first time). my wife had no trouble since she had surfed before. again, a private lesson because of how uncrowded things were. our teacher gave us lots of extra time and we left bruised and exhausted, but had lots of fun.

had dinner at our hotel for convenience‚Äôs sake, kind of disappointing.

**7/4:** our last full day in cr. had a late morning to recover from surfing, lunch at *agua azul* was very good. 

**covid test:** my only real regret with this trip was not planning better for a covid test for our return. i wish i had just got the binax now test in advance, but i had read about so many people doing their tests locally, it seemed easy. and if i had planned it better, it probably would have been. most places were closed since it was sunday. so we decided to stop at the only place open nearby, **los quepos urgent care** for their antigen test. they promised us results before our flight, and to their credit they did, just not by the 7pm they had said, our results instead came at 1am. which made for a stressful night before our flight the next morning at 8am. but i accept that it is my own fault for not planning in advance. in retrospect, since we were heading back to san_jose, we should have just stopped by the airport for the rapid test. it would have come a lot quicker and cost the same.

we then drove back to alajuela that night and stayed at the **alajuela guest house**. a nice, cheap and easy stay near the airport. had dinner at *cevichitos* and had great ceviche!

**7/5:** woke up early and dropped off our car at vamos. again, no problems. they took us to the airport and we flew back to lax. a little bit sadder to be leaving cr behind.

last words: overall, cr was an amazing experience. if you go there expecting it to be cheap like se asia, you are going to be disappointed. that‚Äôs not to say costa_rica can‚Äôt be done on a budget. while our trip was a little bougie, there were always cheaper options for places to stay and to eat. and know that when you pay more than the locals to enter the attractions, you‚Äôre helping fund the preservation of the natural wonders there.

other advice? buy hiking sandals. i bought a cheap pair and despite rubbing blisters into my feet, they were a godsend in the muggy and wet jungles and were useful as water shoes when i needed them. i only wish i bought a nicer pair. i hear keen is a good brand. also, don‚Äôt be put off by the rain in the forecast. yes, it rained everyday, but usually only for an hour or so in the afternoon. mostly it was really nice. as always, ymmv on that one. 

as far as pre-planning everything? we really only booked a few things in advance: our hotels and a couple of big activities. for the most part, we were able to book things the day before, and occasionally only a few hours before, and even a couple times by just showing up at a place. that may differ post-covid and in the high season, but that was our experience. 

tipping? meals include a service charge, so we really only tipped our guides as they all were excellent. as an american, i hate tipping culture and hate spreading it, but the guides always went above and beyond and i believe deserved it.

lastly, heed what people are saying and don't drive at night. sure, driving around town is fine. but don't try to cover long distances in a car in the pitch black. the roads are just too sketchy.

sorry for the long post, but i wanted to be detailed because i always appreciated when others did that in their posts. happy planning and i hope this helps you! feel free to ask any questions below.",1,3030

Just returned from 16 days in CR - Tips and Suggestions,"i just got back from my trip and since i found a lot of valuable information in this sub i figured i'd give back a little.  first off my biases: i traveled with a big group with siblings and in-laws and cousins and nieces and nephews so we were a herd anywhere we went.  lots of kids ranging from teenagers to a 3 year old so kid friendly stuff abounds.  i dislike crowds so empty beaches get big bonus points from me.  some say i'm thrifty, some say i'm cheap.  in either case i try to evaluate if every outing is worth it.  i don't mind eating out at a nice place and paying for a good dinner, but i'm happy to mix that in with days of eating cheap from a local soda or light cooking at home with stuff from the grocery store.   i see very little value in souvenirs but my wife loves them so we try to strike a balance (or sometimes just fight about it) but as a result souvenir shops and artsy beach towns don't do it for me.

**driving**

we all rented cars and didn't have too much trouble getting around.  we arrived on the red eye and immediately headed for the pacific coast.  we passed through 3 toll booths along the way.  they didn't take card and i hadn't exchanged any money for colones but fortunately they accepted usd.  driving was pretty standard for the couple other latin american countries i've visited.  lots of two lane roads, lots of one lane bridges.  lots of bikes and motorcycles and pedestrians on the road.  you'll get stuck behind or become comfortable with passing farm equipment and semis.always check your mirrors before passing because some motorcycle will be overtaking you from behind.  motos will happily pass you on the right or left.  lots of flexibility with double yellow no passing zones and speed limits. distances in km are kinda meaningless.  in san_jose one place was 6 km away, but google maps said it would take 34 minutes to get there.  even outside of the city you may be driving 30 km/h for the better part of an hour on windy roads - i'm looking at you lake arenal.  driving at night did add an extra level as there were still a lot of hazards.  we drove at night a couple times, but for the most part tried to time our travel to avoid it.

**driving part 2**

the rental agency recommended waze.  we ignored that and for the most part google maps was fine.  it did once direct us through a fairly sketchy part of san_jose and try to send us through a series of closed gates.  but for the most part it worked great.

**driving part 3**

we got a 4 wheel drive but would have been fine in a sedan except that we needed the extra seats.  some of the dirt roads had some good potholes so the higher clearance was nice for that. after comparing lots of places we rented through alamo, others in our group did adobe.  one of our airbnb hosts also had cars up on turo.  do your research and make sure you understand the different types of insurance, which are required and which can be covered by your credit card.  this will help avoid sticker shock.  none of us felt like we got pressured or scammed by alamo or adobe.  if you're doing the cc coverage make sure to get the documentation early.  i called and their insurance department was closed because it was a saturday.  i called back on monday (day before the flight) and they said it would take 2-3 days to generate the documentation required.  they said they'd put a rush on it, but it didn't arrive until wed eve - too late.  i had to pay the extra $250 for insurance.

**masks**

you'll need to be masked for any interaction with a government employee.  for us this mostly meant at the entrances to national parks.  all the stores have a sign out front saying they require masks, how much they enforced that mostly depended on how much they catered to tourists.  a grocery store might have a guard checking your temperature while a beachfront shop selling pura vida signs wouldn't care at all.  we tried to be respectful everywhere and wear masks in any business.  the tours mostly said, ""since you're all family we don't care if you wear masks."" but i got the impression that they would be more strict with mixed groups.

**covid**

as of right now you need a negative covid test to get back into the us.  we mostly bought emed tests online before hand and brought them with us. they worked great.  we did the test with a proctor watching on a video call two nights before we traveled home.  we had a couple laptops available but you could maybe get away with a using phone, not sure.  we had a three year old and emed has a minimum age of 4.  we also had one person bring one of the binax two packs that they sell in walgreens/walmart.  the binax ones are for home use only and cannot be used to provide travel documentation, although under the covers i'm pretty sure they're identical.   both times we got them tested in san_jose at clinica biblica the day before the flight home.  they are open 24 hours and results are delivered in 2 hours.  iirc it was 30 mil colones.  just as an fyi there were quite a few prostitutes in this area after dark so this may be a pro or a con for you.  i think i saw somewhere that there is 4 hour testing in the sjo airport, but we all had early morning flights home and didn't want to sit around.  the big downside to the emed is that they only come in a 6 pack for $150.  maybe not a good solution for a solo traveler or a couple.  sometimes you can find people selling singles on fb groups (or maybe on reddit too?)

**rain**

some days were completely dry some days got an hour or two of rain.  one day it rained for a solid half day.  sometimes the rain was light, sometimes it dumped on us.  most of us brought disposable ponchos, one family brought jackets.  the jackets are bigger and bulkier to carry when it's not raining but they are cooler when it does rain.  the disposable ponchos are super easy to throw into a bag and just carry but if the storm lasts more than an hour it can get really hot.  we got a solid 4 hours of rain in manuel antonio and by the end i don't know if i was more wet from rain or sweat.

**fruit**

try the fruits.  we had a mango hater and a pineapple hater both switch camps when tasting how good fresh fruit can be.  try something new.  we stopped at a giant fruit stand and the guy cut open 4-5 different things to try and of course we bought some of everything we tried.  i was super sad that i missed anona season (starting in aug) i ate them in chile known as chirimoya and i was hoping to try them again.

**food**

for the most part food was more expensive than at home.  i guess if you ate like the locals and went heavy on rice and beans it would be cheaper.  but whether we were cooking noodles from the grocery store or eating out every meal was more expensive than home.

**money**

we primarily used cards everywhere.  about 70% of the shops and restaurants accepted cards.  i used an amex and i did run into a few places that only took visa/master but fortunately i carried one as a backup.  i pulled out colones at an atm once, but mostly at cash places i'd pay with usd, get change in colones and then pay with those colones until they ran out.  i didn't find anywhere that wouldn't accept usd, but i wouldn't try it with anything bigger than a $20.  i even saw a local paying with usd at the grocery store.  using usd you'll always get the exchange rate rounded to 600 colones per dollar so you lose a little bit as the official rate right now is 619.

**nightlife**

obviously with a bunch of kids we didn't partake much in the nightlife.  but the sun goes down by 6:00 and places are shutting down by 8:00.  super touristy places will be open later - especially on the weekend, but even in la_fortuna we went into town looking for a quick bite to eat at 8:30 and there were only one or two places still open.  by the time we got our food the cops were cruising up and down the streets with their lights on, i think enforcing a curfew?

**phones**

before the trip i made a plan to buy a sim card in country and use that the whole time.  my sister did this.  she bought a card for 10 mil that they said should last a month under normal usage and she used it up in two weeks.  i arrived in country and got a message from t-mobile that said i had unlimited 2g data and calls would be .25 per minute.  i avoided calling and got speeds faster than 2g in many places and i haven't seen any charges show up on my bill yet.  i did pre download the entire country in google maps and made sure to get my route loaded up the night before on wifi.  you can get directions and push the three dots in the corner and save that route as an icon on your home screen.  this mostly helped me avoid those awkward three minutes at the start of the trip when everyone is sitting in the car ready to go and you're fumbling with the gps.  but it was also useful if my directions got interrupted mid route i could hit that icon and pull them up again easily.

i initially included my thoughts on the areas we visited here but this wall of text got way too long.  i'm going to move them into comments.  happy to answer any questions ya'll have.",1,1729
To those who seem to answer the same questions over and over. Thank you.,i have no itinerary questions.  i will not overload my schedule.   i'm not interested in knowing the typical best spots. you have shown me that they are plentiful. i have no questions about safety and solo travelling.  very few have had real problems . i'm not worried about how to get from a to b.  i can google it. kudos to costa_rica travel for answering all these questions without me having to ask.  see you in 27 days! pura vida!,1,81
Our 16 day trip to Costa Rica with NO CAR,"we just got back from an incredible two-week trip to costa_rica and we didn't rent a car. the cheapest car we could find was $2,000 for the two weeks, including insurance (not including gas of course) so we decided to take shuttles and cabs. i'm really glad we did because the total cost of transportation came to around $700 including tips, thus saving us around $1,500 if you include gas. so, for those of you considering not renting a car: it is totally doable, depending on where you are going in the country. we did have to walk a lot but it's a beautiful country to walk in. it will also help if you know a little bit of spanish because most of the cabbies who drove us spoke minimal english, but even if you don't speak spanish you will be fine. this is what we did:

day 1: flew into san_jose - taxi to hotel (about $5)

day 2: private shuttle to monteverde ($180. our most expensive trip)

day 3 and 4: took taxis to and from hiking trails in monteverde (about $70 total)

day 5: took car/boat/car shuttle to la_fortuna arenal ($60 for two people)

day 6 and 7: took taxis and got rides from our airbnb host in la_fortuna: (about $70) edit: we saved money because our host drove us around for free. without him it would have cost close to $120. we also walked a lot, often for miles, in la_fortuna because we stayed outside the main town.

day 8: private shuttle and boat to tortuguero ($120 for two people)

day 9 and 10: nothing. no cars are on tortuguero.

day 11: boat and taxi to cahuita ($90 for two people)

day 12 to 15: took taxis to and from cahuita/puerto viejo ($50)

day 16: bus to san_jose and taxi to airport ($40)

the only time that we almost wished we had a car was while we were on the caribbean coast. the buses there are rarely on time and sometimes they don't even show up. taxis are super hard to come by and it's a bit of a wild west situation. we ended up making friends with a local illegal taxi driver who drove us back and forth. he was great but travel took longer than normal because of the dearth of taxis. still, we had an amazing time.

would i travel to costa_rica again without a car? absolutely. i personally found a lot of the roads in the mountain areas to be treacherous. they are very windy, often dirt and gravel roads with bumps and deep holes, and fog can suddenly set in at any moment making visibility difficult. i felt very safe being driven by a local guy who knows the roads. plus, we could enjoy the magnificent scenery rather than focus on not driving off a cliff.

edit: one thing i noticed is that everyone we met who also didn‚Äôt rent a car, with one exception, was not american. maybe it‚Äôs the american mentality of car culture that drives them to renting a car, who knows. but i met people from france, uk, switzerland, holland, germany, and canada, and india. i‚Äôm american.",1,537
Costa Rica,"we just got back from costa_rica. it was absolutely amazing. everybody kept scaring me telling me how bad the crime is in cr. we had thee most beautiful experience.. don‚Äôt do dumb stuff like being super flashy or looking for illegal activities getting too drunk or walking off alone.. i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs crime everywhere. but the people we met were super cool,chill friendly and warm.",1,66
The US has been excluded from the list of countries whose citizens can visit Costa Rica from the first of August 2020,"which makes perfect sense given the high infection rates there. it would be good for us citizens to reprogram their itineraries in case they rushed to buy tickets to come here, so they can avoid inconveniences.

Tamarindo (Only): Info Dump,"hey gang, literally just got back from my week in tamarindo, costa_rica last night. this r/ was so helpful to me when i was planning the trip so i figure i'd try to give back as much as possible when the info is still fresh on my brain.

(mods: feel free to edit/remove as you see fit)

* \***rental car**\*: if you're flying into liberia and staying in tamarindo primarily, i don't think a rental is necessary. i got a shuttle from/to the airport at $20 each way. easy peasy.
* \***testing**\*: walking around town, here are some places i saw offering testing required for coming back to wherever you're from. (i'm sure there are more and they usually charge around $65-$85):
   * selina hostel
   * tamarindo diria
   * macondo villas
   * liberia airport: this is a good option, but i saved it as a last resort because a) i hate getting to any airport super early and b) hit/miss in terms of timing if there's an influx of people. i'd rather get it done and not worry about it when leaving.
* \***masks**\*:  ""at your discretion."" regardless if you're vaxxed or not, just have one on hand as businesses require them in store or while ordering food from counters. otherwise, most people don't wear them walking around. just ""don't be a d\*ck"" is the general rule.
* \***vibe**\*: majority of the people (strictly speaking tourists here) skewed towards the ""under-35"" range. there were families and ""older"" folks (drank with a group that had ""milf anna's 50th bash"" t-shirt one night), but for the most part everyone else was young. lots of americans and europeans (tamagringo amirite?).
* \***bars/restaurants now close @ 9pm**\*  kitchens usually around 8:30pm and even then, takeout only. just something of note since you don't want to be caught out if you wanted to eat dinner that time.
   * afterwards, the ""move"" is usually to byob to the beach and hang out there for a bit.
* \***beaches**\*
   * tamarindo: where the action is at. beachside bars/restaurants, etc. most of the surfcamps are here.
   * playa langosta: about 10 minute walk south. a bit more quiet/chill beach.
   * playa grande: north of tamarindo. this beach is massive. 3 miles long. you can either take a cab there or if you're feeling adventurous, walk to the north part of tamarindo beach and grab a lancha (small boat) and they will take you across the estuary. walk the beach at low tide but otherwise you're better off going on a makeshift path through the trees until you eventually get to the main road.

anyways, hope this helps. had a great time so happy to answer any more specific questions people have if i can.",1,457
Our Trip to La Fortuna and Manuel Antonio. (1st part),"my wife and i (26f and 27m) just got back from our 10 day costa_rica trip and felt the need to write something up on here to help others, as so many on this page helped us leading up to our trip. so hopefully this reaches you and helps you out in your trip planning! to let you know a little bit about us we are very laid back people who love to hike, workout, eat good food, and lay out by the beach when we can, so if you have similar interest give it a read! 

cell phone coverage-
we use att back home in the us and opted for the international day pass. it‚Äôs $10 a day for unlimited text,talk,and data out of the country and it was way worth it. coverage was great everywhere we went except in super jungly areas. honestly it was hassle free experience and it was totally worth it. 

rent a car- 
we rented a car and i am so grateful we did, i could not imagine not having one. it was so worth it. we used adobe and would absolutely recommend them, as a matter of fact i will never use anyone else when we travel back. we got a great deal by booking through the forum ‚Äúmytanfeet‚Äù. we opted out of the secondary insurance and used our credit card vehicle coverage. (they are knowledgeable on this based on the card i had and didn‚Äôt even request to see the paper proof i brought, but i would bring copies of the proof of coverage just in case). they laid out all of the costs up front so we knew exactly what we were paying. they put a $750 hold on my card and took it off the second we returned the car. they picked us up right outside sjo airport, and it was a quick 5 minute shuttle trip. the car was very very clean and reliable. we got a 4 wheel drive, but honestly we never came close to even thinking about using it. i probably wouldn‚Äôt be adamant on a 4 wheel drive next time. but double check the area you are traveling to or the location of the stays you booked. total cost ended up being $1122 from the 2nd to the 11th. 

la_fortuna-
- this was by far our favorite part of our trip. we absolutely fell in love with this area. the entire area is so beautiful and relaxing. the town is absolutely awesome to hang out in and walk around. the food is incredibley delicious and very very affordable and the people are so kind. not to mention the activities and adventures are unreal! truly and unbelievable experience and an absolute must go to part of costa_rica! we stayed in a tiny home abnb and it was very very comfortable. it was a little outside of town but i would highly recommend it. i can post the link if anyone‚Äôs interested. 
also, a lot of people here understand english but it is way less touristy and a lot of locals don‚Äôt speak english. if you can, go out of your way to try and learn some spanish. you are traveling to their home country so communicating in their language is relieving for the locals. i got more smiles and more friendly interactions when i would order something or have a conversation in spanish as opposed to english. im not saying become fluent but a few common phrases can go along way! 

the food:
- fortune√±o: this place was great. we ate here several times throughout our stay and literally had the best rotisserie chicken i have ever had in my entire life. it was that good. a little more pricey than other places but still very affordable. the drinks were great, the atmosphere was wonderful, and the batidos (smoothies and fresh juices) and food were delicious. 10/10 recommend. it gets busy at dinner time so make a reservation or get there a little early.
- red frog: we ate here twice, both for breakfast. the batidos and coffee were very very good. the breakfast was pretty limited but everything was pretty delicious. the breakfast burritos and pancakes were very tasty.
- hnos lzos: this place literally has the best fresh fruit and smoothies you‚Äôll have on your trip. it‚Äôs directly across the street from ar√°bigos coffee shop. 
- ar√°bigos: small little cafe but delicious food and coffee. the french toast was absolutely wonderful and their americanos were very tasty
- chocolate fusion chocolateria: this place was unreal! they have pastries and all kinds of deserts as well as chocolates of all different kinds and sorts. we tried a ton of different stuff here and it was all so so so good! we would come in later in the day and sit inside with decaf coffees! it was truly a wonderful place. 
- la principal panader√≠a: there is a street side bakery on the south side of town that we didn‚Äôt get the name of but we came here everyday. the fresh breads and pastries were unreal. the cremita‚Äôs (cr√®me puffs) and pa√±uelos (caramel turnovers) were literally to die for. so so so good!! 
- chifa peruvian cuisine: my wife‚Äôs absolute favorite food of the trip. she wanted to stay and try everything on the menu. literally. it‚Äôs a little family ran spot so things moved very very slow so you have to patient but believe me it‚Äôs worth the wait! 
- we tried a ton of different places and the local soda‚Äôs and they were all so good. if you are into the local cuisine i highly recommend getting patacones literally everywhere cause they are so good. 

activities:
- la_fortuna waterfall: totally must see waterfall. the pictures of this place do not do it justice by any means. it is massive and the landscape is just breath taking. beware the the hike down is a 472 stairs (my wife counted on the way up) we hike/gym frequently and are in very decent shape and it was still a little rough on the way up. but do not let that stop you, because believe me it‚Äôs so worth it. swimming in this waterfall was easily top 10 on my coolest experiences list. 
- the natural thermal springs: this was literally the coolest experience i have ever had traveling. it‚Äôs located right past the tabacon resort. the locals charge you to park but consider it a tourist tax and pay it, it‚Äôs worth it. it gets crowded so maybe go earlier or later but it was honestly fun just being there and meeting people. the water was insanely warm. you can find little pockets and just sit there and chill all day if you want. literally a hot river in the middle of a jungle. the farther you hike up the river the hotter the water is. we stayed toward the base and it was pretty hot still. 
- tabacon: we had booked day passes way in advance and it was very cool, way less people than the free natural river, so we literally had whole pools to ourselves which was very nice and relaxing. water temps were supposedly around 100.4f. we ended up getting massages in a open air bungalow in the middle of the jungle. totally worth it. however, now that we have been once to the thermal resort, we probably wouldn‚Äôt go back unless we were also getting a massage. the thermal pools were nice but we could go sit in the free one all day for $10. just our opinion.
- mistico: the hanging bridges were so cool and i would recommend this activity to anyone going to the arenal area. get a guide. i cannot begin to express how much more you will see. i would never go back here without one. we saw monkeys, sloths, birds, and so many other things that i am confident we would have 100% missed if we were self guiding. this place is a good 15-20 minute drive from town and the road is busy in the morning with all the tourist buses, so plan ahead for that. we were late to our tour, which luckily they were running behind anyways. 
- other than the activities mentioned above, our favorite thing to do was just get food and walk around the town and talk to people, it was so peaceful and nice here.",1,1410
Just back from Manuel Antonio. A quick debrief:,"i thought i would put out some info and recommendations on our trip last week 6/23/22-7/2/22, specifically in ma. we absolutely loved the area and despite it being rainy season still had a decent amount of sun and we all had a great time. i hope this helps someone on their upcoming trip.

ma is so unique, mountainous jungle on the beach. i loved the vibe and we definitely will go back as there was still so much more to do and experience there. at our airbnb we had a sloth, tons of monkeys, iguanas, and parrots. we even had a sloth come into one of the restaurants we were eating at and climb around for awhile, a real highlight of our trip. (i will try to post a video on this subreddit later.) the beauty and lushness of the surroundings made our stay very memorable.

**transportation-** driving is very easy around quepos and ma, we always found parking wherever we went. adobe is the only company i would ever rent from, as many other people on the forum have stated. i called the night before and they delivered a car to our airbnb for us the next morning. they picked up the key from our house manager after we left, didn't even have to fill the tank, they just charge the same rate gas stations do. they made it so easy and it was much cheaper than getting transports and taxis around town

getting to and from ma we decided to take private transport from ilt. they were on-time and it made the long drives stress free. since we were 7 people this made more sense than renting 2 vehicles. we really liked each of our drivers and they gave us a lot of helpful information.

a note on ubers. ubers don't work great in ma. it was fine in la_fortuna we usually had plenty of options, but around ma and quepos i wouldn't go out expecting that there will be an uber available for you to get back. the drivers said uber's prices are too low and it isn't covering expenses, so if you do get one please tip them very well. there is a public bus that runs up and down the main road from quepos to the ma beachfront, it is cheap, and you probably would wait less time for the bus than for an uber.

**ma beach:** there were always plenty of chairs and umbrellas to rent. one person tried to charge us $10-$15 us per chair, but we quickly found most were significantly cheaper. we would rent 4-5 chairs and 2 umbrellas for around 10,000 colones for the day, roughly $15 total. we really liked staying near the bus restaurant (review below) which is where you will run into people on the road trying to divert most of the beach/park traffic. (more on that in a minute) we parked for 3000 colones for the day, literally on the sand up under the trees. it is just a few hundred meters away from the main strip of restaurants, convenience stores, and souvenir shops. we liked this place mainly because of the quick access to the bus restaurant, en todas. the people that you rent chairs from will bring a menu and you can have great food and drinks brought from you, but they are just ordering from the en todas and marking it up considerably. we liked sitting in the shade of the outdoor seating of the restaurant, and it is no more than 50 meters from the beach. 

when driving to the beach as you get close you will likely have some people standing by the road trying to slow you down, blow a whistle and/or flash a very unconvincing badge (like a regular badge, not trying to imitate police). they are a bit aggressive trying to convince you to park at their spot, which is right at en todas bus restaurant. they are helpful when it comes to parking, and aren't pushy about what you offer to give for the parking. (i gave 3000 c). the issue is if you don't want to park there, and you are obviously a tourist you have to keep waving them out of the way to get further down the beach or to the ma park. there is more parking up further, and a few more people offering parking for a fee, which is just free parking anyway. i am happy to pay a few dollars to park in one of the spots knowing they are keeping an eye on the car. i wanted to document this as i saw a few tourists get a bit upset or anxious at the confusion of having people approach their car in the road at the first stop. they can be a tad pushy, and even step in front of your car, but overall they are okay and will let you by when you persist.

**groceries:** there are so many little and a few larger grocery stores around, and you can easily find anything you need. most will deliver groceries to you as well if you prefer. you can find stores for all of your beach necessities too, so don't stress about packing everything in your suitcase.

**restaurants:** we never had a bad meal at any restaurant, far from it, most were excellent. my wife and i went on this trip with our 5 adult children all in their 20's, so there was a lot of eating happening. :-) here are a few standouts that we got to experience during our time in ma: 

*-sodas.* first and foremost these were our favorites. the local sodas, whether on a roadside stop as we travelled around the country, or in the bigger cities, each was a wonderful experience. we were always warmly welcomed, and often given unique offerings to try including ""grandmother's recipes"" of stews. homemade hot sauces, delicious breakfasts, and each had a wonderful local neighborhood environment. we got to cheer on local soccer teams on tv, pet the friendly dogs, etc etc. support the local sodas and as with every place, tip well.  

*-oceano.* recommended to us from an expat, when most restaurants had waiting lists to see the gorgeous sunset, this little place is just a bit further up from most of the restaurants and. had plenty of seating. they have bar seating, small tables and a few large tables for bigger groups. the seafood here was easily the best we had. i highly recommend the appetizer tuna three ways, which is sashimi, tuna tartar and seared sesame tuna. best tuna i have had in my life, and i eat a lot. gorgeous sunset view.

*-en todas* (beachfront bus restaurant). what a treat to eat here on beach days, i would have been happy if this was the only restaurant we had eaten at for our whole trip. whole fried snapper, seafood rice dishes, smoothies, ice cold beers, tropical drinks, etc etc. they churn out a shocking amount of food for beachgoers ,usually brought to the beach by guides helping the tourists. we elected to sit at the covered outdoor seating for a break from the sun, and the waiter was fantastic. they have free wifi and take credit cards, so no wet/sandy money is necessary.

*-jolly roger.* we weren't expecting much, we went here for the live music mainly, and they have burgers, wings, and pizza as their main dishes. our kids said the burgers were excellent, and they were huge. i opted for cauliflower wings and had the best i have ever eaten. so many sauces to pick from too. we all came away from this place pleasantly surprised at how good everything was and they had great drinks to pick from as well as a few draft beers from the brewery in dominical, fuego brewery.

*-colina's wood fired pizza.* on a very rainy evening we decided to stay in and relax after a long day at the beach. this was the best pizza of the trip and my kids talked about it a few days after about how good it was. online ordering and delivered right to our airbnb made it so convenient. i wouldn't hesitate to have one brought down to the beach. 

*-el avion.* this one is brought up all the time on this forum, and for good reason. i had heard that you should come for the view (it is great) and for the experience (it really is worth a visit), but i had seen a few people say the food was just okay, so we came in with that expectation but were once again blown away with how delicious all of the food was. (pasta dishes, rice dishes, asian tuna dish was out of this world, and my poke bowl was a perfect last dinner of our trip. yes, everyone does el avion on their trip to ma, and you should too. (they also have a bakery that opens at 6am).

\-ice cream. make sure to try pops wherever you go, it is popular for a reason!

&#x200b;

**quepos-** check out the marina and the shops, it isn't huge but makes for a fun visit. this is where you will go if you do a half or full day fishing charter, or get on one of the tourist boats for the day. the convenience stores and a great breakfast place open early to accommodate everyone going out fishing. we did a half day out and had a lot of fun. in the main town there are typical touristy shops mixed in with a few unique ones. 

also, you can go to cafe milagro's roastery and watch the coffee being roasted right there, get great bags of fresh beans as well a fresh cup of your favorite hot or cold coffee drink to-go.

&#x200b;

as far as the ma park and some of the other nearby experiences i think that those are well documented on this sub, so i won't leave detailed reviews on those again.",1,1674
Can we try to be more positive?,"instead of snarky comments like ""forget it.  come next year.  but don't expect to be welcomed.""  can we just provide the information that the op has asked for?  

yes, we don't know when the borders will open.
yes, we don't know which businesses will have survived.
yes, we don't know what the restrictions will be.

but we do know that tourism is important to a lot of costa_ricans and we should be encouraging that.  national parks and beaches will still be here!  cloud forests and rainforests will still be here!  volcanoes will still be here!   

please, let's try to take a more positive attitude towards answering questions.  this doesn't mean to encourage people unrealistically - yes, things will be different.  but we don't need to put people off by being so negative.",1,133

Quarantined in San Jose for 10 Days - How it ended,"by now, i'm finishing this post from the comfort of my own home in the us. i will post links to resources in a separate comment later since i kept getting asked the same questions in my last post.

if you want to skip this long story then my main pieces of advice:

1. do not rely on the ministry of health. they will answer questions with more questions if you get an answer at all & overall to seem to have no reason behind some of their actions or at least do not communicate amongst each other. we were fortunate that consistently reaching out helped us get things done in time. 
2. get vaccinated & boosted if available to you
3. if you test positive, do not get tested again. if you chose to do it again that same day then sure, it may work out. testing any day after that is a major risk. if you test positive again, the 10 days restart from the day of the new test. if you test negative, it doesn't change the original positive result & you still have to wait 10 days.  
you do not need to test negative to be able to leave. you will be emailed a letter to say you completed your mandatory 10 days and are free to go in place of that test. i say all this since there is an article that contradicts this & will tell you to do otherwise.  
i repeat, it is not worth the risk. 

*here we go...*

**person 1**: they tested negative, got on their flight to boston, & went on with life with zero need to quarantine upon arrival. it did not matter that they were with the rest of us who all tested positive.

**person 2 (best friend)**: they tested positive at the airport testing site. was not allowed to leave until stating where they will be spending their isolation. was able to reach out to the rest of us & we quickly found a nearby hotel to quarantine since we got our positive results shortly afterward. received isolation notice on day 2. reached out to the ministry of health via email with questions. they repeatedly were told us ""you will all receive your letter of recovery after 10 days"" & that's it. no clarification of exactly when as we had already rescheduled our flights for day 11.  stayed asymptomatic the whole time.

**person 3 (aka me)**: i tested positive at a lab outside the airport. definitely had a cough & headaches but no other symptoms. thought it was a cold. no other symptoms after day 3. did not get my isolation notice until day 5. contacted the ministry of health via email who gave the same answer of ""you will receive your letter of recovery after 10 days"". on day 7, i received an email from someone new from the ministry asking why i am not answering their phone calls (never got any) & how my isolation is going...in atenas. we were in san_jose & repeatedly stated as such for the past 7 days in everything we wrote. i corrected them, asked questions to receive no answers, & never heard from them again.

**person 4 (my boyfriend)**: tested positive with me at the same outside lab. much slighter cough. no symptoms past day 2. no isolation notice until day 5. contacted ministry of health via email & answered exact same questions we did. they were able to call the number provided to us via skype and were told the same line. was soon sent a letter stating he was free to leave isolation 4 days early but still could not leave the country until day 10. shocked, we all contacted the ministry to see if we'd get letters as well since they knew we were all isolated in the same room & were met with silence.

by day 5 we had realized the ministry of health had no intention of answering anything we asked & had to use reddit to figure out what to do from here in case we did not receive letters of recovery. was recommended to find a local doctor who could write formal statements attesting to our health and say we were free to fly home on day 10. entire time nobody came or called even once. nobody stopped us from leaving the hotel. the doctor gave us letters of medical clearance but stressed formal letters from the ministry are better & simply hope we receive them on time. regardless, we had letters granting our ability to leave & that made things much more optimistic/less anxious moving forward. day 10 we received an email asking how we felt the last 3 days, we answered with everything being fine, & were given our letters of recovery (aka freedom!) soon after. just in time for our flights on day 11

&#x200b;

if you've made it this far then you're probably in the same situation as we were and hopefully something here helped you figure out what to do next. the reddit community truly was the ones giving us the most answers, things to hope for, and became our guides. eternally grateful for everyone who helped. i want to help those like others helped me so if this didn't answer your questions then don't hesitate to ask",1,892
My 10-day trip to CR as a 22F solo traveler w/o car | Itinerary + activities + tips + packing list," **background:** 22f, first solo travel experience, spanish speaker (although this is not needed), didn't rent a car, end november to early december, booked flights 2 months in advance, housing 1 months in advance and activities 1 week to 1 day in advance

**what you will find here:** 10-day itinerary, activities and costs, overall tips on trip and transportation, packing list

this subreddit has been incredibly helpful, so i wanted to share all the information that i would have found helpful while planning my trip. please note that i organized the trip by myself, i am not sponsored by any company or hotel. activity prices might change based on companies, but i just wanted to be transparent in case it helps your planning process! i am happy to answer questions if there are any :)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*10 day itinerary\***

**day 1: arrival at sjo and left to la_fortuna**

\- i arrived on thanksgiving day and thought customs would take forever, but it was only 15min

\- in the baggage claim area, you will find a claro stand (i got a sim card with 5g for $20) and an atm (i recommend you use a card that refunds you atm fees, so you can already withdraw colones for your trip)

\- i took a 3pm cr paradise shuttle from the airport to la_fortuna (it was 1h delayed)

**day 2-3: la_fortuna**

\- combo activity of la_fortuna waterfall + arenal hike + hot springs river (the free one)¬† i would give it 9/10. cost $65 with transportation and lunch included

\- maquique canyoning 11/10 this was one of my favorite activities in my cr trip. the guides also take videos and share it with you for free. cost $75 with transportation and lunch included

\- sloth tour: i saw 8 sloths with my guide, who was booked directly from my hotel and it ended up being a lot cheaper 10/10 cost $20 with transportation¬†

\*if i had an extra day, i would have visited the mistico hanging bridges

**day 4: travel from la_fortuna to monteverde (santa elena)**

\- 8am boat-jeep-boat to monteverde from la_fortuna, $25 (manu companies offer this for a similar price, i did casa batsu)

\- curi cancha guided tour with naturalist (i really enjoyed this activity, this reserve is similar to the monteverde cloud forest, less touristy and has a lot more animals) 10/10 $45 (park entry included in price), transportation was $5

\- kinkajou night tour 8/10 (it's at 8pm and since it's late, it is a little tiring, but you get to see night animals and you experience walking in the jungle at night)¬† cost $28 (with transportation)

**day 5: santa elena, monteverde**

\- extremo ziplining: i loved this activity, this company has the most km in ziplining and also includes 2 superman and 1 tarzan swing. a video of the tarzan swing is taken as well as pictures through, the cost of that is $20. activity cost $59.4 (with transportation)

\- trapiche coffee, chocolate and cane tour: coffee grows in this area, but cacao doesn't. cane is not common in cr. i liked the coffee part, but the rest seemed a little too staged for tourists. 8.5/10 cost $45 (with transportation)

\*if i had an extra day, i would have done el tigre waterfall hike (it's a private property where you can hike or hike + do horseback riding)

**day 6: travel fromm santa elena to quepos (manuel antonio)**

\- i took a shuttle bus with cr paradise shuttle at 7am and we had a 1.5h delay

\- i recommend you stay in quepos if you want to experience more tico culture and are not looking for a resort-like experience. there are a lot more food options here and it's cheaper to stay here

\- there is a bus connecting quepos to hotels in manuel antonio and playa espadilla. it rubs every 10min, 5am-9pm i believe and it's only 390 colones. easy to take and reliable!

\- relax at espadilla beach, you can rent a sun bed and a parasol for 3,000 colones. there can be strong waves, so be aware when you swim and you will end up with a lot of sand in your swimsuit¬†

**day 7-8: quepos and manuel antonio**

\- guided tour at manuel antonio national park: i chose 8am and that's when most tourists come as well as groups, i wish i had done a later time (11am or noon) 8.5/10. activity cost $55 (includes entry and transportation)

\- surf lesson in playa espadilla: 11/10 i loved this one. there are many classes available, just walk around and ask to find the best price. cost of $45 for a 1.5h class, surfboard for the rest of the day, sunbed and parasol for the rest of the day, fruit and water all included in price

\- william mangrove tour with a kayak. 9/10 very unique experience where you get to see a different ecosystem that it's hard to see on your own with a great local guide. cost $65 with transportation and breakfast included

\- visit playa biesanz: take the manuel antonio-quepos bus, stop at hotel mariposa and walk for 20-30min to get to this secluded beach. not as touristy, with barely any waves, and more relaxing than playa espadilla. you can rent a sun bed and parasol for 3,000 colones too

**day 9: travel from manuel antonio to san jos√©**¬†

\- i took a shuttle bus at 8am and we had a 1h delay

\- i did a free walking tour (you pay what you want at the end with tips) with guru walk. 7/10 the guide was good, but i felt that there wasn't that much to see in the capital. this is the one activity that i wouldn't have minded skipping $0 + tip

**day 10: flight home**

\- took an uber to the airport (around 7,000 colones), remember to sit in the front

\- it is recommended to arrive at the airport 3h before your flight. plan in advance since the road to get there can have a lot of traffic

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*overall tips\***

\- i booked all my shuttles through bookaway and i chose the cheapest options (each trip was around $35). although there were usually delays of 1-2h, i would still recommend this option over driving if you are on a budget and don't want to use public buses. all these shuttles have ac

\- uber is illegal but it exists in certain towns/cities. you will just need to sit in the front to pretend you are not in an uber. there are several apps used, uber is one and didi is another one

\- do not book activities through viator or tripadvisor. if you want to lowest prices for activities, message your hotel/hostal/host for help and always pay in cash. by doing this, i saved an average of $20 per activity

\- the weather in late november/early december was great and rain mostly happened in the afternoon (around 4pm). plan to do activities as early as you can in the day and do not be afraid of unexpected rain (if there are no thunders) during activities

\- leave san jos√© as soon as you arrive, since there is not much to do

\- i felt safer here than in the usa. just be smart and self-aware, but you will be fine :)

\- most tourists are english speakers, so i struggled to find activities in spanish. if you don't speak spanish, it will definitely not be a challenge for your trip. if you speak spanish, you will mostly be placed in the english group and the guide will switch between languages

\- the cheapest places to eat are sodas or small restaurants that google maps does not even show you

\- i had no issues drinking water in all the places i visited

\- how can you meet people? most of the people i met were from the activities i signed up for and the shared shuttles. i also talked to locals a lot. i never felt lonely during my trip

\- since i had a short trip, i did many activities. i was tired by my last day, but i am glad i got to experience so much!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*must haves in packing list\***

\- waterproof short hiking shoes: comfortable go-to shoes for my trip, wore them during all my hikes and walks. it got muddy on the outside, but my feet were always dry

\- water shoes: this is a must if you do canyoning, go to beaches with rocks or go to the hot springs

\- i didn't see a single mosquito on my trip, but i brought it just in case

\- rain jacket for monteverde and ponchos for everywhere else

\- sunhat

\- quick dry clothes and towel (it takes 2 days to dry things sometimes)

\- dramamine for motion sickness

\- mineral sunscreen that you can use during water activities

\- long hiking pants that are very breathable for forest/jungle hikes

\- blister cushions for hiking/walking",1,1511
AMA - Quarantined in San Jose for 10 Days,"since i'm currently stuck in a hotel room for another 9 days, i figured i'd share my experience so far & answer any questions on how things are being handled for anyone who might end up in the same situation or what to expect in case it does happen to you


arrived december 3rd: no symptoms 

the entire trip we experienced absolutely nothing out of the ordinary & enjoyed our vacation. we were temperature checked, asked to wash our hands multiple times a day before entering businesses & after activities, ate dinner outside always or cooked dinner in our airbnb. we carried multiple masks & wore them everywhere. rented a car that was brand new so we were the first people to use it & never had to take any sort of public transit. 

december 8th: three out of four in our group tested positive. this isn't some moral story to get vaccinated but the only difference we could think of is that 4th person received their booster a week before leaving while the rest of us are fully vaccinated with booster appointments scheduled for the weekend of our return. oh the irony. 

myself & my partner got antigen tested at a lab outside the airport so we found out while enjoying what we thought would be our last lunch. the 3rd was antigen tested at the airport & was not allowed to leave until filling out paperwork that stated where they would be quarantined for the next 10 days. we were able to pick the 3rd up at the airport & immediately head to a hotel that would accommodate us.

we all requested to retake the test & upgrade to a pcr test for more accurate results in case of a false positive but were told no. the first test result will stand regardless of what any subsequent tests will say & we had to admit 3 out of 4 people can't be a fluke despite still experiencing zero symptoms at that point. by now, 2 of us have developed a cough. 

we purchased trip insurance so all flights were rebooked with ease, claims to cover the out of pocket purchase of a last minute hotel were submitted, & all our jobs have been understanding about the extended trip. the hotel has delivered us their free breakfast, has a restaurant for dinners, & brought up any deliveries we've ordered. the rental car company is coming to pick up the car themselves. the hardest part now is just getting thru the next few days in a room we cannot leave.

sorry this was so long. feel free to ask about anything i may have left out since we've just started this unwanted extra adventure.

update: we're on day 7. so much has happened that a whole, long 2nd post will be necessary to document the outcome for each of us since none of us have had the same experience with the ministry of health despite quarantining together & have not read about our unique experience anywhere else. in the meantime, we're all still fine and any minor symptoms we've experienced have passed. all expenses have been reimbursed as well so a major lesson here is to get vaccinated (with boosters if available to you) & always buy the travel insurance!



edit: updating to let everyone know i used allianz for the travel insurance company since 99% of the questions i've recieved were about this topic. 

also after going back & forth with them on the claim, i finally received my funds back for the hotel as of feb.10th aka 2 months after the claim was submitted with a bit of arguing in-between",1,612

Native Costarrican here.,"hello everyone, recently a friend told me about this subreddit and we where commenting about how it shows us the interesting way in which turists see our country. also the fact that there are basically no natives here.

so i just wanted to come in and give you all a few tips on experiencing cr. the good, the bad and the security. 

in the forests;

1. my country is a big magical forest, we love it. some places you will go are all turisty and others are more adventurous. but in any place you go; remember to take good walking shoes, prepare for rain and respect the wildlife 

2. for ideas about turisty places in cr i suggest you ask a turist, we locals usually prefer cheap or even free places.

 *all beaches in cr are public* that means that if you drive along the beach long enough you will always find hidden gems you can visit. even if a house or hotel says they own the beach, legally that is not true. 

national forests are a must! 

i personally use this site a lot; (https://quebuenlugar.com). it has complete reviews about amazing places to visit, their dificulty and price. 


3.talk to the locals, most people are nice and willing to help. but never never never leave your stuff unattended or walk along a lonely place at night.

4.wildlife is beautiful; but if you want to see them up close try conservation centers or for a non-adventury (its a zoo) thing try zooave close to the alajuela airport. do not! go to simon bolivar zoo in san_jose, that place is depresing. (personal thought)

5.super important! when going on a river always check with the locals about the posibility of a 'cabeza de agua'. and if in a tour, make sure your tour guide checks. a 'cabeza de agua' happens mostly in the months at the begining and end of the year (rainny season), and are big build-ups of water that come crashing down the river with no warning. that stuff kills and there is nothing you can do but prevent.



in the city;

1. costarricans are usually very nice and most can pretty much communicate in english (it's taught in all schools). but just as i said before; never ever leave your stuff unattended (not even in your car) or walk in an unsafe place. if you have doubts whether a place is safe; ask a receptionist at a local hotel, or a clerk at a convenience store.

2. taxis! i really recommend you uber, 100% better sincerely. 

but if you still want to use taxis; know they can not charge you a flat rate. they have what we call 'marias', they are little machines that count the kilometers and tell you right there on the screen how much you owe in colones. if you get  on a taxi and the 'maria' is not in plain view - ask for it - or they will charge whatever they want and that is illegal.
also they can not charge extra for anything, except going inside a motel (that i know of).

that is pretty much what i can tell you that you absolutely need to know before comming here. other than that ask anything you want i love being helpful. greetings!

edit.
forgot something important. 
addresses... pretty much non existent. 
prepare to use waze ( like most costarricans do) or google maps, or the old fashioned asking very often (not recommended).

also driving here is an adventure in itself.


edit:
hi everyone! 

just a little heads-up to all of you coming over to my beautiful country for the holidays. 

1. remember you do not need to tip in cr, unless you want to. 
2. in your check they will add a 13% tax that includes the tip (might be a little higher soon). 
but if they add more than that, the restaurant might be trying to scam you... be careful.
3. try uber, but if taxi remember they have the rate on a machine on the dashboard. 
4. please mind your belongings, do not leave your car in dangerous places. and try to stay in touristy areas if posible. 

lots of love‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
enjoy your trip. 
pura vida to you all",1,709

Best driver in Costa Rica!,"i‚Äôm not one to usually write reviews like this, but i took the advice of another redditor (rebecca) by contacting this driver and it ended up being the best decision of my whole trip. carlos is a driver located in la_fortuna but willing to drive to most parts of costa_rica or connect you with someone in his network of friends/family who will offer you a fair rate. i highly recommend to anyone looking for a private driver in cr.

contact him via whatsapp at +506 7170 9978 and tell him ellie sent you.

my friend and i looked into renting a car but after a long day of travel to get to cr, the last thing we wanted to do was worry about navigating unfamiliar roads in sometimes intense and sudden weather. carlos picked us up from the sjo airport (waiting hours for us to get through an unusually long customs line and continuously reassuring us not to worry about the wait) with cold water and a snack, drove us safely to la_fortuna and later on manuel antonio (in addition to destinations in the la_fortuna area). he made us feel like we could stop at any moment for any reason (a picture, a bite to eat, etc. ) and was a joy to talk with. when we needed a ride from manuel antonio to the airport at 5am, he took care of it! 

when i lost my wallet, he went out of his way calling the police and contacting other drivers and contacts in his network in la_fortuna to help me find it.

and when we travelled from la_fortuna to ma, we stopped at his uncle‚Äôs property with an ancient tree and wildlife and hot springs that were a highlight we never would have seen otherwise!!

this on top of the constant good recommendations and availability throughout our trip. carlos was an invaluable part of our trip being such a success and i hope he can be the same for yours!",1,337
Just got back from a wonderful safe trip from the guanacaste area.,"i thought i would share some information just in case anyone is looking for some. coming from georgia this trip was actually safer than being back home. everyone was wearing masks everywhere we went no complaints, living the pura vida life - still happy and friendly. before you entered most businesses there‚Äôs either a wash station or hand sanitizer. including the liberia airport. we purchased the recommended government sagicor insurance for my boyfriend and i and it ended up being about $150 total. i am sure there are cheaper insurance options, the only other one the government offered was way more expensive and these i have zero dollar deductible which seems like a smart idea given the circumstances. we went for six days stayed at w reserva conchal as we had points. wonderful area. we did some private transportation to and from dinners and even our rides were sealed, sanitized  and required temperature checks. eventually we ended up renting a car to get around easier through adobe rental car by the airport and easy experience. we didn‚Äôt know they provided transportation to and from the airport or we would have done that from the beginning. we did some tours but opted for the private tours and they were great. wave riders surf school in tamarindo was so fun! everything was very clean. the point of this message is so if anyone else was unsure as i was hopefully it helps you ease your mind. the people there need tourism to survive and seem committed to doing it safely and with a great demeanor. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,264
"If you need a driver in Costa Rica, between SJO to La fortuna or Liberia to La fortuna or from la fortuna to anywhere, I have a guy for you.","i looked around here asking about drivers and i just got back from my trip and thought i‚Äôd help who helped me .
so i used one company while getting in between destinations in costa_rica.  it seemed to be the cheapest private transfers we can find. everyone else quoted us astronomical numbers, so if you‚Äôre looking for transfers call or whatsapp these guys and they will quote you. 

http://liberiacrairport.com this is their website

but before you do that, call carlos and see if he can do it.

while in la_fortuna, we called an uber and met a guy named carlos. had we met carlos earlier, we would have hired him for our private transfers because he was willing to do them for the same price or cheaper. apparently uber is illegal in cr, but him and a few friends still do it and formed a network. he was absolutely an angel of a man. we decided last minute to go do an activity and he waited for us for 2 hours and didn‚Äôt charge us a penny extra (we obv threw him some more money). anyway, i told him i‚Äôd post his number around here and he was grateful. 
he is based in la_fortuna but he does airport transfers. his calls take him everywhere obviously but if you‚Äôre flying into sjo or liberia he will happily come get you and if you‚Äôre going somewhere else he might still take you or send a friend.

have a great trip guys. i just had the best time in cr and if anyone needs anymore advice i‚Äôm happy to help :)",1,279
Just back from CR... Let's settle the 4x4 debate,"so we just came back from cr last nite after spending 6 days in cr. i won't bore you with all the ""oh how lovely it is there"", because you already know. here is our itinerary

**day 1 land sjo at 5 pm - stay at holiday inn by airport**

**day 2 - 8 am drive to la_fortuna** 

**day 3 - full day in la_fortuna**

**day 4 8 am leave for monteverde** 

**day 5 - full day in monteverde**

**day 6 - 8 am leave for sjo airport - fly to new york**

we had rented a regular sedan with vamos but we got lucky and we got a nice little suv (not a 4x4) from them. it was a honda suv but i could tell it didn't have much engine power regardless of being brand new. we were really scared about driving in cr specially since we had no 4x4. here is my takeaway from this trip regarding cr driving at least in the areas i visited.

\- a 4x4 is definitely not needed. a regular sedan or suv will just do fine in 95% of the places. we saw enough tiny suzuki, elantras or toyotas climbing up the hills. you could tell the engine was screaming its guts out going up the hill but they were still managing just fine.

\- 95% roads we drove on were paved and just as good as any roads in us. super smooth and barely any potholes. many highways are being expanded and paved as you can see the work is going on. seems like government is working to make them even better.

\- however, 99% of the roads are single lane and they are also narrow so you gotta be careful while driving; specially in the mountains. see image below

\- also you will get stuck behind big buses or slow cars sooner or later. this is when you can find a clean spot to jump the double yellow line and overtake them. just don't do this on the hills though. see below image

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/ksj1dsbx4d181.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=045185f653434e0f391d30abadef3932762d16aa

\- roads to la_fortuna from sjo were super smooth. however, up in the hills there are no guardrails or shoulders on the side of the roads. so it becomes scary. be very careful while driving. definitely not advisable to drive at night up there.

\- from la_fortuna to monteverde it was same. roads were super smooth and a sedan will do just fine. once you get close to monteverde, the last 10 miles were not as good. you will encounter some potholes and patches where the road is paved but not been repaired for a while. still doable with a sedan.

\- the only place where you would really thank your stars for having a 4x4 is when you go to cloud forest. we did selvatura park and not the others (sky adventure, etc) so we had a bus pick us and drop us off. but that 30 mins up to the park entrance was completely unpaved and super bumpy. we still saw a bunch of elantras climbing up.

\- i was very impressed with how safe it was to drive in most places. people follow rules and drive safe. ymmv when it comes to driving within san_jose town but overall i didn't notice any rash or crazy driving. there are a lot of bikers but it was completely safe.

\- driving at night is fine too within cities. i would highly recommend that you **do not drive** between cities at night (like sjo to monteverde, etc) because there are no street lights on highways and mountains are extremely dark and scary to drive at night.

\- one final thought. we were very lucky that we nearly didn't experience any heavy rains. so things can  probably change for driving if it's pouring heavy. but i still feel you can very easily manage in regular car. if you can afford a 4x4 then sure go for it but for us the price difference was nearly 4 times to get a 4x4 and we didn't want to pay that much. good luck!",1,692
Just returned,"i just got back from a 7-day long trip to costa_rica and traveled along the west side of the country near santa teresa/montezuma, la_fortuna, and san_jose. i'm having some serious post travel depression after coming back to the states, but we're definitely recommend going for anyone that's just looking on here. feel free to ask me any questions about travel requirements or any tips or tricks!",1,69
Tamarindo is more than Tamagringo,"we haven't completed our trip yet but i wanted to share that the chatter around ""tamagringo"" really made me nervous before arriving. i would consider myself well traveled and i especially enjoy visiting central america. i can easily understand and read spanish, but i'm a horrible speaker, largely due to some neurological problems (i don't even speaking english well lol). i always try to eat and stay local, no all-inclusives, nothing too fancy. from the accounts on this subreddit i thought tamarindo might be my personal hell but i've been pleasantly surprised. my fiance and i are scouting the area to have a super simple wedding at the end of november. it's really more of a family vacation - half of his family have never left the country, my parents are getting old and are saying this is the last time they'll ever travel this far, etc. for that reason we couldn't go too far from an airport. multiple flights and 14+ hours of flying is hard on younger kids and older adults. adding a 2-4 hour drive and/or having to spend the night then drive the next day just wasn't going to happen. hence - tamarindo. it was accessible. here are some of my thoughts:

1. it is not big. the main road is busy, it would be nice if they restricted car traffic, but it's honestly a smaller town. i was told 500 permanent residents. i've had more selection on a caye in the ocean.
2. pricing at beachside restaurants and obvious tourist traps are expensive. duh. it is not hard to find cheap beer or, better yet, stop at duty free. fruits and veggies are plentiful and cheap. honestly don't grab the first thing you see and you're fine, it's not hard to eat and drink cheap here, you just have to look and ask.
3. tamarindo beach is a little more crowded in the central area but the ""ends"" are pretty empty. better yet, langosta and grande are beautiful and empty during the week. highly recommend.
4. it has a lot of people from all over the world, which can be fun to strike up conversations. this also benefits the food scene. i can see how people think it's not authentic for that reason, but i suppose i view it as a reality - main hubs attract variety. take it or leave it, i don't think it's necessarily a bad thing.
5. it's really accessible and a great jumping off point for other attractions. there's a larger variety of hotels to meet budgets, plus i was able to more easily find handicap accessible rooms, if that is a concern for your family.
6. yes, there are beach vendors, but they have not been aggressive with us. nothing like guatemala or belize.

is it my favorite beach town in ca? nah, but i don't hate it, either. people here seem to know it has a reputation and they're actively trying to prove it wrong. tourists are tourists, we haven't ran into anyone ridiculously obnoxious so that's a bonus. wanted to write this as a different perspective - it is not completely awful, i think you can get an authentic experience, and if you go off the beaten path just a little bit you'll find some treasures.

First time traveler to Costa Rica and wanted to share my experience with other first timers planning their trip,"hello all! i recently returned from my first trip to costa_rica and wanted to share some of my experiences in case they help other first time travelers planning their trips. i spent a lot of time reading info on this sub leading up to my trip, and i know answers to questions and advice on this sub and in other places can be conflicting, but this is my take on what i experienced. let me know if you have any questions!

basics: when planning we decided to spend our whole trip (1 week) in the same area (except for the last day, which we spent in the mountains north of san_jose). we wanted the trip to be more relaxing, and not spending every other day or so driving. we chose manuel antonio because of the wildlife in the area, and also the proximity to beaches and other activities we wanted to do. we flew in and out of san_jose, and stayed in an airbnb in ma. we went the fist week in december, so the rainy season had just finished. 

weather: as mentioned, we went right after rainy season ended. leading up to the trip i was checking the weather everyday and it seemed to always show 50% - 80% chance of rain. while we were actually there it maybe rained for anywhere from a half hour to 2-3 hours a day most days, mostly in the late afternoon or evening. it was pretty humid the whole time, but the weather never affected any of our plans. everyday was high 70s / low 80s. wear lots of sunscreen even if you think you don‚Äôt need it! 

car rental: we rented a car for more flexibility, and it seemed like it would end up being cheaper for our group than hiring cars and taking public transport. we used vamos and i would highly recommend them! they were very reasonably priced and their customer service was impeccable. since our flight arrived so late we stayed in a hotel by the airport the first night, and vamos delivered the rental to my hotel in the morning. everything i read warned me about the mandatory insurance coverages, and luckily one of my credit cards offered the cdw coverage as a benefit. i called my credit card company about a week before traveling and they sent me a letter to give to vamos certifying they offered the benefit. a day or so before we traveled i checked in online, and then uploaded the letter, my drivers license and passport, so the car drop off in the morning was super quick and easy. dropping it off as we were leaving was also quick and convenient, and a shuttle took us right to the airport after. 

driving: i was nervous to drive after reading a lot of the posts, however i quickly got use to the flow of driving and had no problems. yes, people drive differently than i‚Äôm used to in the us, and the motorbikes definitely seemed to have their own set of rules, but if you are a defensive and observant driver, and don‚Äôt do anything risky, you will be fine. i do recommend reading up beforehand on what to expect from drivers and driving laws (for example: if you get in any type of accident you need to leave your car in position- it‚Äôs illegal to move the car to the side of the road). the biggest issues we dealt with were rouge motorbikes (doing things like passing on the left to make a right turn in front of our car), getting stuck behind slow trucks going up mountains, and having to merge into traffic at intersections where no one seemed to stop or have a right-of-way. there also wasn‚Äôt always a ton of parking in towns. driving from sj to ma was relatively basic and there were a ton a nice towns to stop at along the way for food, sightseeing, and shopping. 

people: i cannot stress enough how friendly and welcoming everyone was. we were in a more touristy area, but most of the people we encountered spoke some english. i never felt unsafe in any of the places we were in. 

food: one of the people in our group is somewhat of a picky eater, so admittedly we didn‚Äôt go to a lot of the sodas or restaurants i would have liked to go to. however two of the tours we did included lunch at local sodas after the trip, and the food was great! i definitely recommend getting casados at a local soda once or twice. i had great fish dishes at the restaurants as well. we didn‚Äôt find we needed reservations for any of the restaurants at the time of year we went. no one in our group got sick from anything we ate, and we all drank tap water the whole time without issues. 

other: everywhere we went  accepted american currency. prices were generally what i would pay in the us or slightly higher (except for some items in the grocery stores which were a lot more). i have t-mobile cell phone service and it worked ok (slow data a lot of the time) - but i didn‚Äôt get (or need) any sim cards or international service plans. fyi: everyone‚Äôs favorite activity was either kayaking through the mangrove estuary, or ma national park. if you go to the park definitely spring for a tour guide!

i loved the trip and can‚Äôt wait to go back and see more of this beautiful country. if you are planning a trip and want to know more specifics on any of this or our experiences feel free to ask!",1,951

Recent Trip to CR Caribbean,last night in puerto viejo in july!,1,7
Amazing Driver in Costa Rica,"i recently returned from a trip to costa_rica, and during my stay i used a driver that i found on this subreddit. 

carlos, /u/arenalrides , was an amazing driver who was willing to drive me from la_fortuna to coco and back. he was extremely safe and cautious the entire time and was willing to make stops if i wanted to take a picture or grab some food. he even stopped to point out some wildlife that i hadn‚Äôt noticed so that i could take a picture of it.

if you ever need a ride anywhere in costa_rica, i highly recommend you reach out to carlos. his whatsapp is +506 7170 9978. his prices were extremely fair.

thank you carlos for playing an important role in my fantastic week!",1,131

"Trip Report: Costa Rica, Nov 18-26, 2019: Arenal/La Fortuna, Monteverde, Manuel Antonio","trip report for two usa adult 40-somethings and their 9 year old daughter over thanksgiving week, 2019.  

monday: lax -> sjo, easy flight.  we took it as a red-eye and it is not long enough to get much sleep.

tuesday: landing in sjo, cleared customs without incident.  short wait for bags.  all the atms in the terminal are in public with everyone staring at you.  i needed to get a week's worth of money and didn't need a target on my back so we figured we'd hit one once we got the car.  this was a bad move, they are hard to find.  should have used the atm at the airport.

easily found shuttle to budget car rental.  got car without incident, mandatory insurance was expensive (as predicted).  i got a mid-sized (small) suv, four wheel drive (never used it), stick-shift (just to show off).  the automatic was another $50 for the week and in retrospect i'd have done it - there is a lot of stop-and-go driving and my clutching skills needed work after a 15 year break.  i was surprised that all the cars in the rental car lot looked mostly the same - the small suvs didn't look different from the large suvs, and in fact none of the compact cars looked much different from the suvs.  i didn't know what kind of driving to expect but in retrospect if you were trying to save $100 i think one of the tiny compact cars would have been fine.

headed for arenal / la_fortuna.  stopped at an exit to get some snacks.  finally found a small supermarket but they had no atm.  asked for directions to the nearest atm, after significant discussion i was given turn by turn directions to go approximately 100 miles, so we decided we'd wait.  eventually found (via gps) an atm that was 10 or so minutes off our route.

stopped for lunch at la casona del maiz nearby.  delicious - we were starved.

the gps says we took 5 hours to go 45 miles to arenal, but i don't remember it taking that long.  we certainly did meander and get out and look several times.  it's beautiful country and the drives are pleasant.

montana de fuego resort & spa.  we had a superior bungalow which are easily the nicest rooms there.  (there are more expensive rooms that are just not as nice.) this resort caters to americans and europeans.  they have a small hot springs pool (warm), restaurant on site, very nice and clean.  there is a trail in the hotel grounds called ""sloth trail"" (or something) we saw our first sloth about 50 steps down the trail.

drove back into fortuna for dinner (we don't do hotel food), ate at pollo fortueno.  delish, and great service.  really great service.  

wednesday: we'd booked a horseback ride through the hotel.  hotel contracts it to the place across the street (directly across the street), i'm sure you could save a few bucks to book direct with that place.  just the three of us and a guide - we'd booked a horseback ride up arenal, but on arrival the guy said the ride up arenal was mostly on a road, and you get there and... that's that.  if you take a ride down by the river, you see wildlife and lots of scenery.  the three of us really wanted to ride fortuna, but we gave in to this guy's recommendation, and he was 100% right.  the ride was amazing.  he pointed out all kinds of animals and flora and local history.  this horseback ride was the highlight of the trip.

after we ate lunch at el novillos del arenal, it was ok, i wouldn't return.

drove to arenal park, paid the small admission fee and hiked up the hill.  good hike, great view.  (tired 9 year old.)  arenal park closes promptly at 4.  i know this for a fact because when we went to leave at 4:45, we were locked in and everyone was gone.  we managed to flag down a passerby who called someone, and 5 minutes later we were rescued.

wife wanted pizza for dinner, we returned to town and ate at restaurante cafe mediterraneo.  great pizza and great ambiance.  

got a scoop of ice cream after at chocolate fusion.  also had really good service here.

walked around town.  nice little tourist center here.

thursday: put on our swimsuits and swam at the locals hot springs: https://goo.gl/maps/q3cpv6d3dcwkjjhqa.  spent an hour here and seriously could have spent all day.  wished we'd have blocked out more time for this.  another highlight of the trip.

this was a travel day to monteverde.  great drive, beautiful views.  stopped at ""cafe & macadamia"" on the way for lunch.  seriously the best lunch stop possible.  delicious food, reasonable cost, right at the halfway point.

stayed at pension santa elena, a hostel in the center of town.  stayed two nights, got to know basically everyone staying at the hostel in a period of two days.  

took a night hike with wildlife refuge monteverde.  this was my wife's one wish and she loved it.  my daughter and i were miserable and cold in the rain for two hours.  but my wife loved every minute.  we did see some cool stuff. bring a flashlight, the ones they hand out are cheap and not bright.

friday: hostel offers breakfast and it's delish.  the hostel folks had helped us book a semi-private guide at monteverde nat'l park and the tour was good.  we didn't see quite as much wildlife as we'd hoped, but the guide was very knowledgable and the price was reasonable. about a mile before monteverde nat'l park there is a parking lot with the world's largest sign, ""official parking, monteverde nat'l park"".  you will be stunned to learn this is not the official parking for monteverde national park.  drive another mile or so, park on the side of the road for free, walk to the entrance.

friday afternoon we booked a zipline at salvatura adventure park.  before we booked it there was a lot of debate about which company to use, they all boast different features.  after having done it i'll suggest that they are all mostly the same and it doesn't matter that much.  salvatura was great and we really enjoyed it.  after the zipline, salvatura offers a 7-bridge walk and we took a *very* long walk across 7 hanging bridges.

the town of monteverde is very small and very touristy, the food is overpriced and mediocre.  i wish i'd have cooked at the hostel, but we had some forgettable tourist food this night.

saturday:  drove our newfound hostel friends to the ferry terminal in puntarenas.  continued towards manuel antonio.  stopped at crocodile bridge.  stopped a bit later for our absolute best soda experience, soda la katolika.

stayed two nights at jungle creek villas, a vacation rental run by an overbearing canadian ex-pat.  monkeys come right up to the house in the trees and plenty of macaws.  

watched the sunset from the beach outside the national park.  the locals will help you park at the beach.  when you get out of the car they will ask for for a thousand (or a few thousand) colones, and if you pay them, they will watch your car so nobody breaks in it.  if you don't, they will break into your car while you're gone.  it's a really clever system, so i paid the guy, and he didn't break into my car.

sunday, did the manuel antonio national park.  didn't hire a guide, did it diy.  before arriving in costa_rica i read that if you hire a guide in one national park, you will get the idea as to whether you like it or not.  we'd done it a few times and decided to go without this time.  it was a good move.  once you know how to find monkeys and sloths, you will find them.  
the guide book mentioned how specific areas of the national park had less populous beaches, but i found most of the beaches pretty deserted, none moreso than others.  we set up camp and played in the beach most of the day.  pro-tip, park on the main road, not the skinny road on the way to the national park.

had a forgettable expensive dinner at el lagarto.  if you go, make a reservation.

monday: drove back to san_jose.  hotel for the night was trapp family country inn.  the most delightful thing about this place is their address: ""400m west of soccer field, costa_rica, alajuela"".  through some oversight, i booked a room at this place for two people instead of three.  upon learning we had a 9 year old, they wanted $35 for her to stay - half again the cost of the room.  i protested, but when they have you by the balls, they have you by the balls.  i paid the add'l.

wanted to check out san_jose and heard horror stories about driving and parking.  took an uber (or lyft?) to downtown san_jose for $20.  great move, highly recommended.  went to the central market and ate a ton of food and bought souvenirs.  walked all around town and saw the city.  ubered back and went to bed.

tuesday: returned the rental car and took an early flight out of sjo.  priority pass lounge at sjo was totally serviceable - not a heavy breakfast but enough to not leave us hungry.

things i'm glad i packed: raincoats, umbrellas.  water hiking shoes were absolutely crucial - if you can  bring only  one pair of shoes, bring water hiking shoes.

things i packed and didn't need: bug spray, other bug-related things.  we didn't really encounter any buggy flying biting things.

things i wish i'd have brought: a poncho for when the real rain comes.  a flashlight.

some years ago after a trip through various third-world countries, we ended up in barcelona.  when describing our arrival in barcelona, she later said ""it's the kind of place where, when you flush the toilet... you know what's going to happen"".  

costa_rica had this same sort of appeal.  it's rugged and green and underdeveloped, it's bio-touristy and the people are ""pura vida"" and low-key.  but if you want a drink of water, you just turn on the faucet.  when you poop, you flush it away.  the roads are paved and food is readily available.  highly recommended for anyone.  easily doable and totally worth it.",1,1746

Notes from my trip,"just got back yesterday. 10 days total. 8 in country, 2 travel days. this was my first trip to cr. thought i'd share some thoughts about cr. 

covid:  
testing was pretty simple, but the labs are not in a convenient location outside of san_jose. we had to change some plans since there are no labs close to monteverde, where we planned on ending out trip. we added a couple days in the middle of our 10 days in la_fortuna. we used the rapid test and had the results the same day. cost was \~$50usd.

people and businesses in tamarindo were much less concerned with cv19 in general than in other areas. masks were worn indoors by most business owners/employees, but by few tourists. we would ask if they wanted us to put masks on when entering restaurants/shops and most of the time they did not want us to put masks on.

it seemed the further from the coast we got the more people we saw wearing masks indoors and out. businesses nearly always wanted masks on to enter, even sometimes when everything was outside.

getting around - we drove quite a bit. liberia>tamrindo>la_fortuna>monteverde. i found the driving very enjoyable. you most definitely have to pay attention and drive carefully, but i never felt unsafe. most roads are in decent shape. i was very glad to have paid the extra for a 4wd suv. mostly for the additional ground clearance provided. never came across any roads that i thought were impassible with 2wd. 

ticos just walk along narrow winding roads where cars are speeding through. they wouldn't even look up at the cars coming. i would come around a blind corner to see a couple kids riding their bikes up the road. i slam brakes and give them a wide berth - they wouldn't even glance at the car. definitely not at home!

dogs everywhere just hanging out. they all appear to be well cared for and well behaved. they just cruise around the town/beaches at all hours. i actually really enjoyed the dogs and thought the tico attitude towards dogs was great. 

we stayed in airbnb's the whole time. all of them were great, aside from the usual latin america construction standards being generally lacking. hosts were all responsive. places were all clean and relatively inexpensive.

food: we went to puerto rico a couple years ago and were very disappointed by the poor quality of the food. cr was the exact opposite. we only had one bad (mediocre, really) meal the whole time. pinto gallo, cassados, arroz con pollo, burgers, salads, pizza - ticos know how to cook! everything we had was fresh and delicious. it was more expensive than i expected and at least one place padded the bill by about $5, which i didn't catch until we were leaving. we could've found cheaper food, been more cost conscious, but i just didn't feel right bargain hunting with everything going on. seriously, though, the food was spectacular.

the monteverde cloud forest reserve was a disappointment. the staff there was rude, entrance fee is steep ($25 per person just to walk the trails), the food in the cafeteria was meh, and the cloud forest was nothing that we couldn't have found elsewhere. to top it all off the suspension bridge was closed and by the looks of it not going to be open any time soon. i would skip it and go to one of the many private reserves in the area, where they will probably be thrilled you are there - unlike the staff at the reserve. there are also some really cool trails through the forest around santa elena that we enjoyed much more than in the reserve - and they are free!

that's all i can think of right now. i'll update if i think of anything else to share. feel free to ask if you want to know something specific.",1,657

9 Day Trip Recap: La Fortuna / Tamarindo,"this sub was so helpful in planning our trip, figured i'd give a little recap!

4 of us (all in our 30s) went on a 9-day trip to cr. flew into lir and spent the first half in arenal/la_fortuna, and the second half in tamarindo. we did not rent a car and instead relied on private drivers and uber.

**some trip pics here:** [https://imgur.com/a/ewblhgx](https://imgur.com/a/ewblhgx)

&#x200b;

**part 1: arenal/la_fortuna**

**restaurante mimi, canas:** on our way to our hotel, we asked our driver to bring us somewhere not for tourists, so he brought us here. it's definitely a locals spot. it was a super cheap buffet, no one  spoke english and none of the food was labeled so we all just experimented and everything was delicious! it was a fun intro to the trip.

**sangregado lodge:** we had an amazing experience here. wonderful hotel, really felt like we were living in the rainforest. it's located about 30 min from the town of la_fortuna. highly recommend.

**ubers:** i knew ahead of time that it's illegal in cr but we tried it anyway, and for the first 3 days had zero problems. it worked just like it did back home and was very inexpensive. then, all of a sudden, like a switch flipped, it became difficult. every single driver would send a pm asking us to cancel the ride and instead pay them double the fare amount directly. we ended up asking them to cancel the ride (which they did), then we'd negotiate a lower rate and pay them directly in colones. as annoying as this was, according to others we talked to, it still cost us less than the red taxis in that area.

**mistico hanging bridges park:** i've heard differing opinions on this, but our hotel basically shared a parking lot with mistico so we figured why not. we took a tip from a staff member and went at opening (6am?) and had the place entirely to ourselves. it was nothing short of magical and we saw some monkeys and beautiful birds. 

**maquique canyoning:** cannot say enough good things about this activity. 10/10. so much fun, beautiful weather, helpful staff. if you're in the area, definitely do this excursion! 

**arenal 1968 hike:** if you hate hiking, pick the yellow trail and not the red one! learned the hard way but very glad i finished it. outstanding views at the end too. 

**la_fortuna waterfall:** did this the same day after the volcano hike, lol. bad choice but it still worked out. it really was beautiful here but the water is freezing!

**fruit:** we picked up lots of roadside fruit, but the best pineapple i ever had in my life came from a tiny fruit market across the street from the maxi pali market in la_fortuna called frutas y verduras joan. they skinned and sliced it for us and it was amazing.

**part 2: tamarindo**

**la choza de laurel:** i'm sure this place exists solely for tourists since it's across the street from lir, but we loved it. the food and service were great. the coffee is fresh and free. they make an amazing lemonade and other drinks. we saw a guy delivering produce to the restaurant and he let us buy some pineapples off him and he cut them up for us. we liked it here so much we made this our last stop before leaving cr.

**the coast hotel:** this hotel was really amazing. i read plenty about what to expect tamarindo to be like (and it was), but our hotel was at the farthest end of the beach, and by that point there's nothing for anyone to see, so we mostly had the whole beach to ourselves. both the hotel and beach were clean and quiet. really good choice for anyone not into partying/late night/bars.

**antichi sapore:** i feel weird saying that the best meals we had in tamarindo were at an italian place, but this restaurant was outstanding. felt the need to give it some love here.

**llanos de cortes waterfall:** beautiful, quiet, wonderful. went as part of a longer excursion.

**rio celeste:** beautiful and glad i got to see it, and happy that it was blue that day! the hike just to get to the falls is not for the faint of heart. i only went halfway down the stairs, took pics, and went back. at this point i was done with stairs and hikes, lol.

**other notes:**  
\-i was surprised by how clean every public restroom was. even the ones resembling outhouses or located along hikes were clean.  
\-we only really used colones and credit cards. barely touched our dollars. however no one ever wanted to give us change back when we gave them colones. it was always a big deal. even at the supermarket where the locals were shopping. anyone know why that's a thing?  
\-brought tons of bug spray and didn't need any of it, lol.  
\-don't buy any food gifts at the souvenir shops. get it at the local grocery store! all the chocolate bars/chips/honeys were wayyy less this way. i didn't even think to do this until my friend suggested it.  
\-we did the entire week without buying a sim card or using data. we used wifi exclusively the whole trip and relied pretty heavily on whatsapp. i know not everyone has the luxury of forgoing data for a week but luckily we were able to and it worked out just fine for us. we also downloaded as much info as we could so we could access it when offline (google translate, maps, currency, etc).

lastly, i have to give a shoutout to u/arenalrides (carlos as you all probably know by now). he provided both our airport xfers, our hotel swap xfer, and hooked us up with a driver one night in la_fortuna when all the ubers were being dicks. everything with him was seamless. he was always responsive and easy to reach on whatsapp, and often answered many general cr questions i had for him. i'm truly so glad we decided to go with him for our transports, and am thankful to all the members of this sub who suggested him!

overall, this entire trip exceeded expectations. i definitely expected stuff to go wrong, expected some over-hyped tourist attractions, and figured we might get bad weather in the rainforest. but the weather, the excursions, the hotels, and especially the people really were just amazing. i went into this not knowing much about cr and unsure of if i'd enjoy myself, and now i already want to go back and explore other parts of the country. a huge thanks to everyone from this sub for all the tips and tricks i used along the way!",1,1127
Sexual assault at Hacienda Guachipelin,"update: the guy was fired. 

i got a formal letter from guachipelin confirming it. native's way, the tour operator that took me and the other 2 women there got involved and pressed for a resolution. i'm pleased. of course this should have never happened but there is almost no accountability for this type of thing. i'm so thankful for this community's support. thank you all for your comments, they've really buoyed me in this experience. <3

----------------------------

heads up to the community about this place. i visited yesterday with a native‚Äôs way tour. we did the adventure combo at guachipelin which includes zip line course. 

part of the zip line course is a tarzan swing where you swing and are caught on the other side. their staff member, some teenage looking kid, caught me by the boobs - like, cupping my breasts with his hands. at first i thought maybe it was an accident but he literally had his hands on me, i was already on the ground and stable, and he‚Äôs just holding my boobs. 

next, same kid is supposed to hook you up to the next zip line. this guy gets me all set up and connected, and now his hand is in between my legs. i literally pushed his hand off me. 

just off the course i went to the bus where two other women in my group said the same thing happened to them by the same guy. 

i spoke with the manager and then with their general manager. it was a strange convo and i don‚Äôt know what is going or if they‚Äôve actually gotten rid of this guy. their manager was very apologetic and said they were going to do an investigation and talk to hr, but i‚Äôm the same breath she‚Äôs telling me this might have been unintentional and just an unfortunate catch position. let me be really clear that women know when it‚Äôs unintentional/accidental and when they are being touched inappropriately by someone who has the right cover to deny it. she also said that she asked our tour lead and other tours and no one else said anything. i hate that i need to explain to another woman that women almost always don‚Äôt come forward with this stuff. three women on one bus don‚Äôt require extensive investigations and the secret shopper program she told me about to validate that you have a problem. 

she promised me an update on the hr meeting that i haven‚Äôt yet received. i would strongly warn others to stay away from there until they make it eminently clear how they‚Äôve handled this situation.",1,437
"Trip Recap August 2021 - two weeks: Arenal, Monteverde, and Playa Flamingo and COVID notes and procedure","i found these helpful, so thought i'd post my own review with tips.  i won't disclose specific airbnbs we stayed in but you can dm me if curious; we stayed only with superhosts and the properties were easy to find. for car rental, we used **vamos**\- good experience and you definitely need 4wd.

**days 1-3 arenal:**

* *lodging*: an airbnb across from mistico park and loved it!  around mistico park, you're 20 minutes from la_fortuna, and there aren't many food options nearby, but the wildlife watching is amazing.  we saw coatis and toucans right outside our windows.
* *activities*: our airbnb hosts booked all these for us.
   * sky trek zipline - amazing!
      * covid note: my travel partner and i were the only ones wearing masks other than the employees (we wore kn-95), and there were about 15-20 other individuals in close proximity on our zipline experience.  this was near the beginning of our trip, so we weren't too worried given that we had about 13 days until our tests.
   * mistico guided night tour - cancelled for thunderstorms and switched to 6 am bird watching tour - great guide, but underwhelmed by mistico park.  we saw a three fingered sloth and rainbow toucan, though.
      * covid note: guide wore masks whole time and so did we; i felt safe.
   * tabacon - day pass with lunch; i know some people say it's overrated, but i loved it! we spent all day there, and each got a drink at the swim up bar.  we thought that even though it was expensive, it was an incredible value for a delicious three course lunch and super relaxing experience.
      * covid note: they take your temp at the door, and despite being a popular attraction, spacing out is very possible.  we only wore masks entering and exiting the facility. we felt safe.
   * arenal national park trail - a bit underwhelmed given that great views of arenal were available throughout our lodging area and in la_fortuna.  nonetheless, the view of the summit of the trail is incredible, and we saw some bulls super up close near the exit. spent a half day here exploring and doing the long trail.
* *favorite* *restaurants:* soda lapalma - best casado we had and great view of volcano. arabigos coffee.
   * covid note: it was customary here to wash hands before entering any restaurant.

**days 4-7 monteverde**:

* *lodging*: an airbnb walking distance to the center of santa elena
* *activities*: our airbnb hosts booked all these for us.
   * kinkajou night tour - great value at only $25 / pp and saw two vipers, a sloth, some really cool bugs, and two sleeping toucans. the reviews of kinkajou ding them for crowding around animals. i did not find this to be the case.
      * covid note: the tour is guided and they conducted it in groups of 4 with the guide. everyone wore masks and we felt safe.
   * don juan coffee, sugarcane, and chocolate tour - one of our favorites!  the coffee is monteverde's specialty so this part of the tour was more impressive and longer.  chocolate and sugarcane were still good. samples were the best part.
      * covid note: tour is guided and was conducted in a group of 5.  everyone wore masks and there were lots of handwashing stations, but we were a little worried by the fact that people were all grabbing the same samples from fruits and plates, putting their hands to their mouths, and going back for more.
   * selvatura park - sloth sanctuary and reptile room.  these were both overpriced, and i'd skip selvatura if i did this again.  the sloth sanctuary was cooler than the reptile room (which was like the snake room at a zoo).  we got great up close views of two fingered sloths.
      * covid note: toured in group of 4 and everyone wore masks.
   * santa elena reserve - cheap and good exercise.  spent a half day here doing several trails. would do again.
      * covid note: we brought masks but didn't really need to use them.
* *favorite* *restaurants:* (all in santa elena): sabor tico - great casadas; taco taco - mexican style tacos; cafe zuccaro - for coffee.
   * covid note: like arenal, washing hands before entering is customary here.

**day 8 casa chameleon at las catalinas**:

* this was the splurge of the trip.  one night at this $700 resort was definitely all we could afford, but we stayed in the room basically the whole time so it was worth it.  the resort has its own private plunge pool with ocean view *in each suite*.  our suite was super private, and we didn't even wear swimsuits.  perhaps most romantic experience of my life.  the service was incredible.  definitely eat at the restaurant.  we didn't even go to the main pool area because we liked our private pool so much, but you can get a day pass for the main pool.  worth it for the views.

**days 9 - 14 - playa flamingo**

* *lodging*: airbnb about a 10 minute walk from playa flamingo.  it was so hot that we just ended up driving everywhere.
* *activities*:
   * lazy lizard sunset tour - this was a boozefest - unlimited drinks.  super fun and met a ton of cool people.  we saw a ray and several cool fish at the snorkeling stop. dolphins swam so close to the boat that we could see their eyes. rained the whole way back and no sunset, but still had a good time.
      * covid note: this was the riskiest thing we did during the whole trip. around 15 people on the boat; no one in masks.  it was the day before our test, so we knew it likely wouldn't show up if we contracted it, but are still a little worried about it after getting back.  the boat was small, food and drinks were served in the small galley with no masks on, and after a few drinks, lots of mixing and mingling. do not do this activity if you're worried about covid.
   * massages (offered cheap right on the beach by local vendors)
   * almost exclusively just laying on the beach, swimming, and completely clearing our minds. in retrospect, we wish we'd paid more to stay at a place right on the beach.
* *favorite restaurants*: coco loco - right on playa flamingo; incredible prices and staff - we ate here every day; surf box - really good breakfasts but expensive.

**covid tests:** we didn't discover emed in time, so we scheduled (over the phone, about a week early) two antigen tests at hospital metropolitano in huacas for three business days before our departure.  super easy process.  felt like they barely swabbed our noses.  results came back in an hour and a half over email- negative!

***general rainy season tips***: mornings were beautiful, afternoons were 50/50 shot of rain, and we did not go out in the evenings at all. after figuring this out, we scheduled as much as we could for mornings. we kept our sleeping schedule to east coast time; therefore, waking up at 6 am cr time and going to bed around 8 pm--this worked out really well for us, allowing us to max out daylight and good weather.

***general thoughts around covid***: booked this trip for 2 back in may when things were starting to look up with covid.  by our departure in august, the situation with delta variant was concerning us, but we had already paid for airfare and airbnb's so we went ahead with it.  we noticed on this forum that even vaxxed and careful people were getting breakthrough infections.  in retrospect, we both agreed that while we very much enjoyed costa_rica and want to go back, we wish we had booked a domestic trip in the us given anxiety around return testing requirements.  all turned out fine for us, but the anxiety around testing positive and being quarantined was very real--even with insurance, it was always on our minds.  that said, above was our agenda with thoughts! covid notes are bolded--sorry if anyone finds this overkill, but i'm writing what i would have liked to read.

if you're worried about covid, my covid related tips would be:

* wear kn-95 on group activities you're set on (like zipline),
* avoid boat tours, and
* schedule anything you're worried about either at the beginning of your long trip, so you have room to clear exposure before your test or after you've taken your test to return.",1,1431

Very Proud of My Country,"did a little shopping trip this morning that included dropping off some purchases at the local emergency food bank.  it was located in the municipal gym and before arriving, i thought it would be a few people sorting through stuff.  about 20 people and about half the gym was covered with food packages and the spectator benches were being used to sort the food.  small and large packages were made up (each one weighed, apparently) and ready for delivery.  my puny donation looked pitiful - but still, it takes a lot of sand to make a beach!  

after returning home, i went to the facebook page for this effort and saw that they were asking people not to donate anymore for a while as they had so much, they needed time to go through it all.  

quite a few government agencies were involved - it's great to see them in action since there is not a lot going on with most of them.  

later, i went to the supermarket and upon entry, found alcohol and paper towels to wipe the handles of carts as well as hand sanitizer to use.  all the employees were wearing masks.  and hey, plenty of toilet paper!

i then went to the pharmacy to pick up a few things and the ""distance policy"" was clearly in effect.  the security guard gave me a splash of hand sanitizer as i went in and directed me to a line where there was clearly marked 2 meters apart where you should stand.  there was clear plastic covering the display cases and you couldn't actually get right up to them.  everyone was doing really well with distancing.  

next, headed to the hardware store to pick up a few things and they had a drive-in area where i stopped and gave my order to the worker.  they have a basket that you put your credit card in and it is used and returned to you in the basket with the receipt.  we touched elbows and both laughed. 

finally, headed to the macrobiotica to pick up a few things and a lady stayed outside while i was helped by the clerk.  it's a very small shop!  likewise, access to the counter was blocked off.

on the way home, i saw some people waiting in line to pick up the package of groceries for their families and yes, they were observing the distancing properly.  

of course, there is my neighbor across the street who does not observe any social distancing and her husband drives his car whenever he feels like it, whatever the driving restrictions are.  (same people don't use seatbelts or helmets when riding their atv.)  

thank you costa_rican government for taking good care of us and thank you costa_ricans for being careful.",1,464

Travel Warning: Ace Rent a Car San Jose Airport,"i prepaid for a rental car (3 months in advance) at ace rent a car at san_jose airport scheduled for a 5 pm pick up. 

during the flight a woman had a heart attack and we were forced to land at the nearest airport. 

this delayed our flight 5 hours, so we (my wife and infant son) didn‚Äôt arrive at ace until 10 pm. 

once we arrived we were told we have no car for you, today or for the rest of the week. 

i told them we paid in advance and they started laughing at us and asked us to leave. 

i tried to call american express to assist, but they said that since i paid over 90 days in advance they couldn‚Äôt get a refund. 

i tried to find another rental, but was was then told all cars were sold out (this was over christmas), and we would need to take the bus to our destination city. problem was i had my parents and family flying in and was supposed to pick them up as well. 

stuck at midnight in a strip center with an infant, no car, no hotel (all sold out and our rental was in jaco 3 hours away), i tried frantically to get a taxi and find a room. 

finally a taxi came and said his brother in law rented cars privately. 
although it was 1 am and our son was crying i said let‚Äôs try it. 

we ended up paying $2,000 for 6 days for a car. 

ace rent a car refused to answer or return my money. american express tried to help but said it was out of their hands because it was ‚Äúhe said she said!!!‚Äù)

i finally hired a lawyer (out of principle) to get my prepayment returned (it was approx $1,000 for the week).

One of the most-asked questions: Driving in Costa Rica.,"i was thinking about these driving in costa_rica questions as i drove around this morning doing my errands.  i live in a small city (about 40,000) in guanacaste and here is my experience of the morning:

a guy walked into the street in front of my car without looking.

a lady on a bicycle was riding in my lane and didn't bother to move over a little so i could get by.  

a boy on a bicycle zoomed out in front of me from a side street, without even looking.

three ladies were walking in the street, not bothering to move over.  

some of the streets are so narrow and allow parking on both sides.  they are not one-way streets, but become temporarily one way when you have to pull into a space and wait for the oncoming cars to go by so you can progress.

on the highway yesterday, i encountered a car parked in the highway with flashers on.  they guy was talking on the phone.  it's illegal to talk on your phone while driving - but - not illegal just to stop in the middle of the highway, put on your flashers and take a call.

i have seen people stopped in the middle of the highway to change a tire when there is a nice, rock driveway or road like 20 meters away...  

sometimes, traveling in the city, costa_rican drivers treat stop signs like yield signs.

dogs are sure that they own the street!  having a little nap in the middle of the street, they look really pissed off when you blow your horn to make them move out of the way.

sometimes, people will pull up to a store and instead of parking head-in like all the other sane people, they will just park perpendicular, often behind cars that are parked head-in.  sometimes the driver stays in the car and sometimes not.  typically, these are people with expensive cars or trucks.  when the driver remains in the car,  i have taken photographs of their parking efforts just to let them know they are aggravating.  

driving along the four-lane highway between canas and liberia, i was in the left lane doing around 60 mph and passing another car.  the guy on the motorbike in front of the guy i was passing  decided to whip over into the left lane in order to turn around at the next exit point.  i blew my horn because i couldn't stop in time and couldn't pull over because there was this car next to me.  he waved at me like ""go f yourself..."" and i ended up slamming on brakes while he drifted into my lane and then made the turn.  

a guy exited the four-lane highway and stopped in front of me, right in the middle of the highway we exited onto in order to avoid parking and walking over to the vendor who was selling fruit, wanting the fruit vendor to walk over to him and take his order and deliver it so he could just stay in his car.  in the middle of the highway.    i blew my horn at him but he acted like i was the bitch.

so... yes..... driving in costa_rica can be an adventure!  which is why i always recommend to slow down... be ever vigilant and assume nothing.

First trip to Costa Rica. Post trip report #2: Driving in Costa Rica,"you need to be reasonably skilled to drive in a foreign country, where the rules are not familiar and you may not know enough spanish to understand the signs.

* i found costa_ricans to be very polite when it comes to yielding. so remember to do the same. they let me out of many jams lol.
* they do have places to get to, so expect to be tailgated, but don't worry about it. you do you.
* the main highways like route 1, 27, etc. are good quality and easy to drive on
* you don't need change or colones for tolls. just whip out your debit/credit card
* don't be overconfident outside the highways. take your time and pick your way through the potholes and again, let the rude ones tailgate you all they want.  
* whenever you feel like a beautiful view is coming up, keep an eye out for spots to pull over.  there seemed to always be a place to pull off the road and enjoy the view.  allow extra driving time and enjoy!  don't be shy about slowing down to pull over. locals did not seem to be bothered by it.

Rainy season is the best!,"this post is for anyone who worries that rainy season will spoil their holiday.

it won't! monsoon season is awesome... (i've been living in cr for a year) and rainy season is the best! everything is cheaper for starters, because it's off peak. also it doesn't rain all day, it usually starts in the afternoon, so you can still enjoy activities and the beach etc in the morning when it's hot and dry. and then sit on the terrace or in a bar with a beer and watch some truly apocalyptic lightning storms in the evening. everything is greener, everything is more beautiful, and you might even get the beach to yourself because there are fewer tourists.

First Trip to Costa Rica - Our Experience,"first off, this isn't a negative story. costa_rica was better than we had imagined which is crazy, because we had high hopes and even anticipated possibly living there one day.

we arrived in san_jose on january 14th. we got off the a rocky start because the customs officer was a prick. not in an 'i'm doing my job' kind of way. just in an ignorant, i hate tourists kind of way which was strange after what i had read about costa_ricans. i guess we can't blanket an entire population and say they're all nice. 

our luggage showed up as planned and we opted for an uber which we ordered on our devices using the sjo wifi. you do get a lot of people offering drives as you exit the airport. many i'm sure are taxi drivers. we had heard that taxi drivers can be pushy and can take advantage of tourists and that some taxis are legit and some aren't. i don't know if this is true but uber quoted a price that was reasonable and we use uber often at home. we have to go up the stairs outside of the terminal to arrivals and the uber driver drove up to pick us up in a hyundai elantra. we were quote 5,880 crc and tipped 1,000 crc (about $15sh total cad). we got a receipt later in the night for $71 cad. seems the driver added a stop to the trip. maybe a mistake, maybe not. either way, uber had it fixed within 24 hours. no bid deal.

our hotel (la sabana hotel and suites) was very close to la sabana park. the hotel was nice, the pool was nice, the staff and breakfast were a1. the room itself was just okay and the traffic was very noisy throughout the night. we didn't sleep much. our room was road facing which i don't think many are. anyways, no big deal. we ate dinner at pasta pronto which was next door to the hotel and it was fantastic. so much so that we came back on our last night before flying out. we paid with visa. it was a simple tap and a conversion through our bank. there are dee's, but oh well. the receipt did show the 10% service fee of tip we had heard about.

we wandered around the park a bit in the morning before being picked up by vamos rent-a-car. they were great. we paid for full insurance to keep it simple. we had a mitsubishi asx which cost us a little over $1400 cad for 10 days with full insurance.

we drive to la_fortuna, tamarindo, montezuma and manuel antonio with no issues. are the roads crazy? yes. if you're a competent driver though, you'll be fine. the same rules seem to carry over with a slightly lower speed limit. the drivers are aggressive but not in a road rage sort of way. most people aren't  going to let you merge, or let you out of a parking lot. people beep. a lot. but they didn't yell 9r flip each other off. at least not from what we experienced. motorcycles cut lanes and pass on the sidewalk but not in an overtly reckless fashion. roads are thin outside of the city, most of the bridges had one lane so you had to wait much like a construction zone without a flag person.

gas is full serve and simple. nothing crazy here. just say full and a friendly voice and tap your visa. 

what we learned about each place.

la_fortuna - very friendly, tourists oriented town with lots of activities and stunning scenery. we did tabacon hot springs, mistico hanging bridges and visited the waterfall. people tried to make us pay to park on the side of the road at the hot springs. no big deal. the resort had parking of their own and we had a day pass. just use common sense. it was cloudy and drizzly but we were in the clouds. people we all friendly. lots if expats it seemed.

tamarindo - almost too much like any beach town. many restaurants had usd on the menu. banks were easy to find and use. everyone accepted visa. everyone was friendly and the town and beach were amazing. it's load at night but it's a beach town. roads are thin and hard to navigate but it was fine. we loved tamarindo. 

montezuma - we actually stayed between montezuma and sanata teresa. we rented a 4 wheeler from what seemed like a shady spot but the place we stayed suggested them and it was fine. had to put a $700 cad deposit on our visa and paid $160 in cash (usd) at the end and got our deposit back. nobody wear helmets and the roads here are crazy. i'm glad we rented a 4x4 to get in here and glad we had a 4 wheeler to get around with. you could do it in a car yes, but you'd have to be very mindful and methodical. montezuma was very small. santa teresa we enjoyed more. we got stuck in a traffic jam in santa teresa, on our 4 wheeler that lasted about a half hour. someone parallel parked too far out and it gridlocked traffic. nobody got mad. people got out.of their cars and turned off their 4 wheelers / motor cycles and chilled. it was fine. there are more atms in santa teresa than advertised. just look. you'll find one.  again, we used visa at most places. people were all friendly.

manuel antonio - we drive through quepos and jaco to get here. we missed the ferry and had to drive around the peninsula but it was fine. glad we were i manuel antonio because it seemed much nicer than jaco. it was very hilly and this roads. all well paved. place seemed safe, had a vibrant night life, everyone was friendly and everyone took visa. we went to the national park with was stunning. the gift shop/cafeteria in the middle shouldn't be there and is a gross idea but oh well. we saw monkeys steal food from babies and stupid tourists feed monkeys ice cream. don't be an idiot, be respectful and manuel antonio will treat you well. the beaches we warmest here and we saw the most wildlife here. sloths, monkeys lizards and more. also when you are driving to the park, people will step out in front of you telling you you have to park there. you don't. tell them and and move on. they'll blow a whistle. it's annoying but they're not cops and they don't work for the park. we got stopped three times. the park has official parking right before the entrance and it's 3000 crc. when you get out.of your car, many people will try and offer you tours i what looks like uniforms for the park. if they're not in the park, they don't work for the park. they'll tell you it's hard to spot wildlife without a guide. it's not.

we drove back to san_jose on our last day and stayed at a hilton. lame i know but we knew the city was loud and thought this would help us get a good night's sleep. it was still loud but it was fine. we walked to the central market which is probably the craziest place i've ever seen for shopping. the streets were noisy and dirty but it's a city and it's fine. we felt mostly safe walking around in the day but wouldn't do it at night. the roads are not pedestrian freidnly but with common sense you can make it work. we used uber twice in the city to get to our hotel from the rental company and back to the airport on the last day. the driver were crazy, but friendly. no weird charges this time.

tldr - costa_rica is a beautiful country with amazing people but there are shitty people too just like home. use common sense, be respectful, try to learn some spanish and just chill. you can use your visa and debit card at most places and atm's exist. gas is easy to get, roads are fine and waze is better than google maps.

have any questions, just ask. we just got home yesterday so the information is current.",1,1395
"Review: Our trip to La Fortuna, Monteverde, and Manuel Antonio","hi, we just got back today from an 8-day trip to the locations in the title of the post. i wanted to give a review of the places, attractions, and restaurants before i forget too much, and hopefully this helps others. i'll also cover general things that happened that also might be useful for others. 

**general info:**

we traveled as a family of 4 with 2 kids, ages 5 and 8. we used google maps offline mode since our cell phones had very spotty data service. we used **airolo** on both of our phones, and you can expect in these areas that you don't have service frequently or service is very slow. we rented a 4wd suv through avis. take note that with insurance included the rate will be roughly double what you get on the avis/hotwire site.

our driving was roughly as shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/6flo2dxm37h91.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2651a43ebfa57a863eb2e13761af06cdfa13dc83

**liberia->la_fortuna**

we landed in liberia and did the 2.5-3-hour drive to la_fortuna without stopping. google apparently told us ""the shortcut"" as a local told us later. this is the road with lots of giant windmills on the way. the road is *extremely* bumpy with potholes and missing pieces everywhere in parts of it. you can do it in a normal car, but it will be very bumpy and you may bottom out. we used dramamine with our youngest since he gets carsick easily, and the only downside (or not?) was he slept quite a bit in the car since it makes you drowsy.

we arrived in la_fortuna towards night time and stayed a 2 days.

**la_fortuna:**

la_fortuna is a great town with a very small/walkable downtown and lots of things to do. we stayed in a really nice airbnb with a great pool about 5 min from downtown. while there we did:

activities:

1) mistico hanging bridges: this was fun, although expensive. we saw some monkeys, which they said was rare. the hike was pretty easy and you get some nice views, but don't expect a whole lot of wildlife.

2) sloth territory: this was right next to our airbnb and was worth it if you want to see some sloths in the wild. we did not see any wild sloths any other time while there, so it allowed us to see 4-5 of them hanging motionless in the trees. they're very involved with conservation too, so they're serious about protecting them.

3) don olivo chocolate tour: this came recommended by reddit. the tour was fine, but not great. it's 90% a tour for fruit where you get to see the trees and try various fruits. the chocolate only comes at the very end when they give you a few pieces of chocolate/sugar and make you hot chocolate. i thought we were going to get to try finished chocolate bars or more things during the process, but you don't get that. i wouldn't do this tour again, but if you're into eating a lot of fruit and some mediocre chocolate it might be better.

4) tabacon: we did the hot springs morning day pass as people here recommended. tabacon is extremely nice, and a great place to relax. i wouldn't stay at the hotel since it's too far from the main la_fortuna downtown, but the day pass was worth the price. lunch in included, and it's a 3-course meal that tasted pretty good.

food:

soda mima: this was our first food when arriving in town. it was okay. the price was good and the tipico meals were nothing to write home about. my son got a burger expecting it to be like back in the states, but it tasted like a morningstar veggie burgers. 

soda la hormiga: slightly better than soda mima. again, it's very cheap food, but not a lot of flavor. 

pollo fortuneno: we got a rotisserie chicken, fried plantains, beans, etc from here. the food had good flavor, but a bit dry. it was definitely more expensive than the sodas since it's kind of a tourist spot.

**la_fortuna->monteverde**

this drive is similar to the one to la_fortuna. very bumpy and windy. not great for anyone that gets carsick

**monteverde:**

monteverde is a small town on top of a mountain with very little to do. we went there for one night only to do the monteverde cloud rainforest. we stayed in what looked like a nice airbnb, but it ended up smelling of hippies and mildew. 

activities:

monteverde cloud rainforest: after staying the night, we headed to the cloud rainforest around 9am. the entrance wasn't what i expected; it's a tiny parking lot that you have to be shuttled up to the entrance from. once there you wait in line while they check you in, which can take a while (bring an umbrella/poncho. they have some easy/bricked trails to walk and various routes to take. we didn't really see any wildlife here, which was a bummer given the hype.

don rodolfo night hike: we did this on reddit's recommendation. it was terrible. the guide was soft-spoken and was hard to understand. he went pretty fast and didn't give us enough time to really search for insects and animals. then the tour got weird when he started talking to a tree for 10 minutes. i'm not kidding -- he brought out two iron bars and pretended they would move when the tree responded. our kids got very bored and we ended up cutting it short.

food:  
taco taco -- this was one of the best places we ate at on the trip. the food had a lot of flavor and lived up to the hype from reddit. i'm from san diego, so we have good mexican food here, and this was good.

villa burger: this burger place is right by taco taco. the burger was fine (my wife liked it more than me), and they had a variety of options. i would try it again, although i'm not a fan of putting a piece of ham on the burgers, which seems to be common in cr.

**monteverde->manuel antonio**

this drive was much tamer than the previous ones. you only have a short section of windy roads, but then you get to some more paved highways. we saw our first macaw in jaco, so that was cool. on the drive we also broke it up by stopping at the crocodile bridge in tarcoles. we saw 3 crocs since the water was kind of high. there are people trying to sell you souvenirs and possibly trying to charge you to park. just ignore them and make a quick trip to the bridge

**manuel antonio**

we stayed at tulemar for 2 days and an airbnb down the hill the last two days. manuel antonio was definitely the best part of the trip, mainly because tulemar is so nice. we saw lots of monkeys, iguanas, and agoutis. the pools have amazing views, and the private beach is definitely worth the price of admission. our second airbnb was okay, but definitely no tulemar. lots of bugs inside, old fixtures, etc, but it was passable.

activities:

manuel antonio park: the park was not worth the trip for me. it's littered with people selling stuff and constantly badgering you to buy tours as you enter. the entrance to it is a bit weird, and getting there requires driving by people harassing you to park in their lots. i knew this going in and didn't fall for it, but it really makes the whole park look bad. some of these lots are a good 500m away, so it's quite a walk. we didn't see any wildlife here either except for a deer and one agouti, which we'd already seen at tulemar. we did not go to the beach, but it doesn't seem worth the effort to pack/hike to get there if you have the private tulemar beach.

efrain's nature tours: efrain's tour was well worth it. it was raining the whole time, but the pace was good and he taught us a lot. we saw many frogs, spiders, walking sticks, cicadas, and katydids. 

food:

el wagon: besides the great entertainment by the monkeys joining us while eating, the food was awful. one of the worst pizzas i've ever had. it had so much potential being a wood-fired place, but the crust was dusty, hard, and had no flavor. there was too much cheese to the point where it didn't melt, and the whole thing was just a mess. would never go here again.

falafel bar: this one lived up to the hype. the best food we had on the trip. everything we had was really good, and despite being a bit pricy, it's worth it. it does get busy so try going during off-hours.

victorias: also bad pizza, but not as bad as el wagon. would not go here again either, but it was convenient since they deliver to tulemar.

tulemar cafe: again, the breakfast food wasn't good, but the view is spectacular. the food didn't have a lot of flavor and was expensive, especially for breakfast.

love india: decent food. not spicy enough for indian food, but it has a lot of flavor. it's in a very weird location and i think it changed buildings/owners, so you'll see some abandoned buildings out front.

**manuel antonio->san_jose**

smooth drive. not really much to report other than road work

**san_jose**

the only activity we did in san_jose was refugio animal de costa_rica. while it's expensive to get in, it's for a good cause. they have a large number of animals that were given up/taken by them due to injuries or other issues. we learned a lot and got to see lots of animals we wouldn't see otherwise.

food:

jardin de lolita: this is an awesome spot with many food options and a hipster vibe. highly recommend going here on your way in our out of san_jose. there's something for everyone, and it's in a safe neighborhood.

&#x200b;

general notes:

\- stuff doesn't dry in costa_rica. make sure your hotels/airbnb has a dryer. we made this mistake and had to do laundry in manuel antonio. the lady that runs the laundry shop stole several of our garments, and caused a real hassle for us to buy swimwear.

\- gas stations are full service. not a big deal, but just fyi

\- expect much, much worse roads than you'll find in the usa if you're from here

\- the only place we were accosted was manuel antonio park. outside of that, the people were very nice and made traveling pleasant.

\- use google maps offline. i've heard waze is better, but waze won't work if you lose internet connectivity. google maps offline was a lifesaver. despite it giving us a few wrong turns, it worked well.

Costa Rica Trip Report - 3 weeks,"when planning my trip i relied heavily on this sub, so i wanted to give back and share with you my itinerary and experiences. 

itinerary was:

* la_fortuna - 1 day (was supposed to be 2, but got cut short because of the tropical storm)
   * activity: horseback riding along the river with go adventure arenal, was supposed to be volcano view, but there was heavy rain so we went more into the forest. still was quite a nice introduction to the jungle. activity was booked via the hotel.
   * hotel: miradas arenal hotel & hotsprings, lovely hotel with bungalows and hot-springs. really wished we could have had the two days here as it was so beautiful.

&#x200b;

* monteverde - 1 day
   * activity: ziplining [here](https://www.aventuracanopytour.com/). really fun, they claim to have the longest zipline in costa_rica :)
   * didn‚Äôt have time to explore the cloud forest, would probably not miss it and maybe throw in a night tour to see the fauna of the cloud forest. 
   * hotel: la casa de la monta√±a, really nice stay. 

&#x200b;

* manuel antonio - 3 days 
   * activity: we visited the park two of the days, explored it by ourselves. having a guide could be nice if this is the only national park you will visit, but there are so many people stopping for the animals that is really easy to spot them. 
   * hotel: manuel antonio park house, such a nice place and amazing views!
   * took a shuttle bus down to sierpe with [this company](https://www.transportationincostarica.com/). really nice service. 

&#x200b;

* drake bay - 5 days
   * wow just wow! drake is an incredibly small town, but the nature and tours you can take are incredible. i did not book any tour in advance, but i was also by myself. in case you go with more people, i would definitely arrange the tours in advance.  i would recommend to grab breakfast at the nature cafe and enjoy the beautiful birds and lovely owners. 
   * activities:
      * snorkelling to isla del ca√±o (95$) - went with drake divers, organised by my hotel. it was fantastic, we saw whales on the way there and back, and dolphins!
      * bahia drake public trail - hiked this by myself. [https://www.alltrails.com/trail/costa-rica/puntarenas--2/bahia-drake-public-trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/costa-rica/puntarenas--2/bahia-drake-public-trail)
      * night tour with top trails (45$) - quite nice tour.
      * corcovado full day tour - sirena and san pedrillo station (150$) again with top trails - incredible experience. 
      * mangrove tour with sukia travel (114,440$) used this to bring me back to sierpe and spot some more animals on the way out. 
   * hotel: hostel osa tucan drake, simple hostel, very nice owner, she helped me setting up some of the. tours. 

&#x200b;

* sierpe - just stayed because i was travelling by bus and did not have a way up to my next stop in the afternoon. took the bus to dominical with [tracopa](https://www.tracopacr.com/). 

&#x200b;

* dominical - 3 days
   * this was my relax- going out stop. going back maybe i would give surfing a try and hike the nauyaca falls, but i was saving my legs for the next big hike!
   * hotel: cool vibe beach hostel, quite nice hostel. surfy and relaxed vibe. 

&#x200b;

* san gerardo de rivas, got here from dominical with the bus ([grupo blanco](http://www.grupoblanco.cr/)) to san isidro and then took a taxi to san gerardo because i was a bit in a hurry, but there are some busses. 
   * hotels: stayed in hotel roca dura & hotel de la monta√±a el pelicano, both incredibly nice. 

&#x200b;

* crestone base - 4 days, from san gerardo i hiked up the cerro chirripo. it was a hard hike (14,5km, 2000m/6560ft elevation gain). to access the national park you need to register via the sinac website, and then go on this [website](http://www.chirripo.org/) \[that now seems to be under maintenance\]
   * activities: from the crestone base you can do different hikes, the most obvious being the summit of the chirripo, but also cerro crestone, terbi, and some others. really beautiful park to explore different than the other more jungly park i visited. 

&#x200b;

* back to san_jose: 
   * i visited the jade museum & went out in the barrio escalante, very nice block with nice restaurants & bars. ended up in the restaurant apotecario, incredible food and cocktails!  

the experience was amazing, the nature is incredible, and overall costa_rican are incredibly friendly people who helped me out in multiple occasions. 

hope this can help someone in their planning.",1,754
"Just got back from CR: La Fortuna, Tamorindo, and Monteverde","my husband and i just left costa_rica after spending 16 days there for our honeymoon! it was an amazing adventure. we spent some time in la_fortuna, tamorindo, and monteverde. here's our thoughts:

weather in late june/july: in most of these places the weather was warm and sunny in the morning, then the heavy rain would come in mid to late afternoon. just prepare to do all your outdoor activities in the am and chill in the afternoon. there were about two or three days it didn't rain at all.

la_fortuna (3 full days): there are an endless amount of tours and activities to do. the 1968 volcano hike is a good workout and the view of the volcano at the end is gorgeous. we also took a river tour where we saw monkeys, sloths, and a ton of birds. lastly (my favorite) was the tabacon thermal springs. it's a little pricey ($80/person) but it's beautiful. it's about 4 acres of hot spring rivers and waterfalls you can swim in. the day ticket comes with a tasty lunch or dinner. my husband and i were worried the price wasn't worth it, but we were very wrong. if you have some extra cash, i would highly recommend.

tamorindo (4 full days): tamorindo was our least favorite town. it's a party town with lots of bars and locals trying to sell you drugs. we stayed at a hotel in the beach (tamorindo diria). the hotel was beautiful, but once you stepped into the beach, you were swarmed by locals trying to sell you things. we ended up spending a day at a quieter beach 30 mins north of tamorindo, and had a wonderful time. there are a ton of great restaurants,but our favorite was el mercadito. we ended up doing a catamaran tour here which was one of our favorite activities. 

monteverde (4 full days): monteverde was our favorite. here we did ziplining, hanging bridges, and visited the cloud forest. the cloud forest is beautiful. there are a bunch of hiking trails that lead to beautiful views. in monteverde, there is a main little town called santa elena where most of the restaurant and tourist shops are. my only complaint is the massive amount of large pot holes. we didn't rent a 4wd car... so we were taking the roads pretty slow. 

overall, we had a wonderful time. i would love to go back again. i hope some of this helps someone!",1,412

I was beaten and robbed by a pirata taxi driver in San Jose. I have their license number. What can I do?,"yesterday i made the stupid mistake of taking a pirata taxi from the bus station in san_jose. i quickly realized i was being scammed or possibly worse as he was driving in the opposite direction of where i wanted to go, and refused to tell me how much the trip would cost. he then said it would be at least 45,000 colones (for what was supposed to be a 5 minute trip).

luckily, we stopped at a gas station. i got out of the car with the excuse that i was going to the bathroom and i told the gas station workers what was happening and asked for help.

when the taxi driver realized what was happening, he punched me in the jaw, took all the money i had on me, and drove away.

i managed to get a picture of his license, is there anything i can do?",1,150

Two Weeks - Trip Review,"hi fellow travelers! i just wanted to do a quick recap of my own costa_rica adventure, in case it helps someone out along the way. my husband and i just did a two week honeymoon in august, which qualifies as ‚Äúrainy‚Äù season. our experiences kind of contradicted a lot of the advice i‚Äôve heard from others, so i wanted to give my two cents.

we are in our 30s and love to go off the beaten path. we do not like crowds and honestly tend to be a little impatient. we really prefer to do our own thing, and usually on a budget. we don‚Äôt have kids and don‚Äôt ascribe to much of the ‚Äúadventure tours‚Äù that are usually touted. that‚Äôs just us ‚Äì to each their thing! but this is a little info about how we travel, in case our approach is similar to yours. in that case, read on! üòä

our route was:

* land in san_jose and go straight to la_fortuna for two nights
* monteverde for two nights
* miramar (a glamping airbnb) for two nights
* manuel antonio for six nights

**transportation**

we took private shuttles between destinations which felt so fancy, but was less expensive than if we rented a car. we booked through two weeks in costa_rica ‚Äì they were lovely, the drivers were really chill and professional, and the ability to relax rather than stress about those winding roads or aggressively passing drivers‚Ä¶. priceless. 

* [shuttle transfers - book your ride - two weeks in costa_rica](https://www.twoweeksincostarica.com/costa-rica-shuttle-transfers/)

**la_fortuna / arenal**

based on what i said above, maybe it‚Äôs not a surprise that we were not a fan of the guided tours ‚Äì we went on one guided tour in mistico park in la_fortuna and it was not for us. incredibly long, throngs of people, and so much waiting to see a tiny lizard through a telescope or to hear about a special kind of root. the guides are full of knowledge, but by the end of this 2.5 hour walk i felt like i hadn‚Äôt seen anything and was peopled-out to boot.

in la_fortuna, we also did the bogarin sloth trail and paradise hot springs. the sloth trail was a nice walk in the forest; we didn‚Äôt see much but we had a great time chatting with other travelers. it was a nice thing to do on our own terms, though i wouldn‚Äôt do it again. the hot springs were fun but felt like they could be anywhere ‚Äì it was very polished and ritzy, it could have been in las vegas. it was relaxing though! there were lots of pools with different temperatures, and the included meal was way tastier than i expected. 

**monteverde**

next up was monteverde. this was beautiful, our favourite city for sure. it was so remote, fewer tourists, very nice little restaurants, and cute arts and crafts stores. i‚Äôm so glad we did most of our gift shopping here! plus, at least in august, it was much cooler up here on the mountain. in monteverde, we went on a horseback ride at sunset, did a self-guided hike in the curi-cancha reserve and saw quetzals, and went to the san lucas treetop dining (book this in advance!!).

* [home - equus farm (monteverdeequusfarm.com](https://monteverdeequusfarm.com/)
*  [reserva curicancha - beautiful nature trails](https://reservacuricancha.com/) 
*  [san lucas treetop dining experience | un viaje culinario](https://sanlucas.cr/) 

the horseback ride is one of my favourite things we did. it was beautiful and the terrain was pretty intense ‚Äì no handholding here! it felt like the shire. for the curi-cancha reserve hike, we rented binoculars and went our own way. because we were in a small group (of 2, just us), some agouti walked alongside the path with us, we spent fifteen minutes in a little meadow buzzing with pollinators, we saw three of the elusive quetzals, and we spied a whole family of capuchin in the treetops. definitely couldn‚Äôt have had these experiences in a swarm of people!

the san lucas treetop dining was incredible. we are not foodie people, but since this was our honeymoon we decided to splurge. the food was amazing, but the atmosphere, service, views, and stories that went with the food made this unforgettable. they curate an entire experience (with a souvenir!!). i highly recommend it.

**miramar**

in miramar we stayed in this little airbnb (link below). the view was breathtaking ‚Äì we spent almost the entire time just hanging out on the balcony watching the day go by. not much to say, but if you like this sort of thing go for it! the airbnb hosts helped us book taxis as the destination was so ‚Äúoff the path‚Äù that the shuttles don‚Äôt go there. this was also why our car rental would have been so expensive, because the roads are steep. but again, so worth it; it was my favourite place we stayed.

lastly, 6 days in manuel antonio ‚Äì the animals were amazing and the beaches were gorgeous. from our balcony we saw sloths, capuchins, squirrel monkeys, and howler monkeys, plus geckos, vesper rats, and an opossum. really neat!! however, 6 days was wayyyy too long. 

we got extreme culture shock here ‚Äì the prices jumped way up (and honestly, the food was way better in the local spots in la_fortuna and monteverde), tourists were everywhere, and someone was constantly trying to sell us stuff. i thought this was more of a ‚Äúbeach town‚Äù but (for us at least) it was always a thirty minute hike to the beach, and then 30 minutes back up the mountain. and it was hot, way hotter than other parts of costa_rica we had been to. 

in ma we went to the national park (self-guided tour of course, where we saw another family of capuchin completely on our own), went to biesanz beach and enjoyed happy hour at issimo hotel on the way back (cheap drinks and free use of the pool!), got the best massages ever from boena spa, and trekked to el salto waterfall.

el salto waterfall was unbelievable; if you are like us, and enjoy adventure away from people, definitely check it out. you can hop in a taxi and ask the driver to take you to the start of the el salto path. the hike was incredible and technical, in and out of the river and across huge root systems and boulders. there are no (or minimal) associated tours, so we saw very few people. the waterfall itself is about 25 ft, with a climbing rope to quickly get up and down, and a very steep path down the side. we all took turns waterfall jumping ‚Äì it was so fun, so beautiful, absolutely idyllic and definitely my favourite part of the whole manuel antonio area.

**so that‚Äôs it! tldr:**

* don‚Äôt skip monteverde! for us, this was our favourite üòä
* 3 nights max in manuel antonio ‚Äì but definitely check out el salto as a part of it!
* manuel antonio = animals, but hot temps and high prices
* guided tours at your discretion. sometimes you can see more on your own, if you are patient!!",1,1245
My Experience: 9 Days in Costa Rica,"hey everyone! just returned from a family trip down to cr from may 20 to may 29. wanted to review my trip and provide info for you all because this page was so useful to me! we were all fully vaccinated and masked up everywhere we went. we last visited cr in 2014, and wanted to go to resorts/places we were familiar with. 

may 20 - may 26: manuel antonio. stayed in tulemar, and loved returning to that resort. their private beach is extremely convenient, beautiful, and amazing. recommend cafe milagro (a*mazing staff, service, and food)*, la mariposa's restaurant la papillon, falafel bar, and emilios cafe (*closed on tuesdays*). didn't venture out to manuel antonio park or playa biesanz because tulemar's private beach was available to us - which is why i recommend staying at that resort. manuel antonio was very safe and all the restaurants were taking great precautions. we even ventured down to the farmers' market quepos one morning, and felt very safe. 

may 26 - may 29: alajuela. stayed xandari, and enjoyed it for the second time. i will say that it was definitely low staffed, but the staff that served us were very passionate, friendly, and great. xandari is great because it has huge hiking trails, 5 different waterfalls, insane views off san jos√©, and a fresh farm to table restaurant all on its property. great place to stay if want to stay close to the airport. didn't leave xandari in our 2.5 days there. 

in general, wear your masks, make sure you are vaccinated, and exercise caution. the costa_ricans we came across were so kind and happy to see tourists. we were debating on going on not because of the spike in may, and were so happy that we went. i was a little stressed for the covid test to re-enter the u.s., but it was just me overthinking and overusing my imagination (lol at anxiety). it is important to note that the airports in the u.s. were so different from what i was expecting. so many people wearing mask under noses, not wearing masks at all, and not social distancing. but i guess we can only control our actions and be responsible for ourselves...so just stating my observations. 

have fun and pure vida!! :) ama below if you have questions.",1,387
Just Got Back - My Review / Tips,"landed in san_jose.  rented car from vamos.  office is very close to airport.  they pick you up in a shuttle van.  make sure you contact your credit card company before your trip to get a written confirmation that you are covered, other wise you will have to pay for extra insurance.  i suggest you pay extra for gps and they give you a cell phone that will give you wifi access for your phones too (wifi hotspot).

drove to la_fortuna. as a driver from canada i can tell you driving in costa_rica is different.  i would not rent a huge suv because roads can get tight in places.  a toyota rav 4 or honda crv is perfect size.  watch out for motorcycles.  they pass on the shoulder or between lanes if traffic slows.  some cars will also pass you even over double solid lines at unsafe times.  you will have to be patient at times, for example when trying  to traverse busy roads, and aggressive at times, for example when merging into traffic.  if you have a chance to get in, take it.  do not expect others to make way for you.  the gps is not the best when it comes to accuracy.  we used the waze app on one phone and google maps on another phone at the same time.  they often do not syn up and have you going on different paths.  we usually went with the waze route.

la_fortuna was great for hiking.  we did the 1968 arenal volcano hike and enjoyed it (lots of variety in the hike).  we also did the observatory hike.  variety as well but quite a bit of pasture areas.  still worth the trip and not expensive.  lastly we did the mistico hanging bridges.  this i would describe as more of a disney type hike.  pretty expensive and our least favorite hike.  good if you're looking for an easy hike.  warning if you're scared of heights do not go because the suspension bridges are high, with see through floors and move a lot.  it was my favorite part though.  we never took guides as i just don't have the patience to wait.  sometimes you pass guides with groups and you can check out what they're looking at.  if you like to learn about the flora and fauna then i would suggest you get a guide only on your first hike because it would be expensive to get one every hike.  you will know what to look for on following hikes after your first guide.

there are many hotsprings in the la_fortuna/arenal area.  we went to the free ones at the river beside the tabacon resort. very cool.  you will need water shoes to walk on rocks.  if you have a waterproof bag, bring it to protect your phone/camera etc.  pay the locals on the street about $2 or 3 for parking.  for free hotsprings it's worth it.  there were no problems with things being stolen, but don't keep visible valuables in your car to avoid causing temptation. lastly we checked out the la_fortuna waterfall.  beautiful falls, but lots of tourists.  go early.  lots of stairs to climb back up so they recommend anyone with cardiac problems, pregnant ladies or major obesity to use caution.  it's not that bad.  you can take breaks if you need to. 

we stayed at le secreto hotel for 3 nights and liked it.  lots of birds in a beautiful garden.  quiet place, nice staff, walking distance to everything in town, simple but good breakfast.  we liked the soda viquez for value/quality and the reggae restaurant (forget the name) for the ambiance.

after 3 days in la_fortuna (that was enough for us (we are not into zip lining, 4 wheelers, white water rafting), we headed for quepos/manuel antonio area.  we rented a house in quepos  found with the vrbo app.  really cool.  we went to the beach just before (right  beside)  the manuel antonio national park.  there are locals who will ""help"" you find parking.  give them $3 or $4 dollars.  they will charge you $10 for 2 long chairs and a sun umbrella if you want one.  locals are selling things on the beach, just say ""no gracias"" and smile.  no problem.  i do not understand the negative comments i have read about this.  it is not a big deal, unless you're not able to say no thank you to people.

park manuel antonio was amazing for wildlife.  you might want to get a guide if you want to learn about all the wildlife, once again we did not and saw a ton of wildlife walking all the trails. the park is not open on monday. i  highly recommend taking a catamaran tour (one of the highlights of our trip) in quepos which starts at the marina (free parking).  for about $75 each you get a 3 hour tour (choice of 9 - 12 p.m.. or 12 - 3 p.m.).  free cocktail drinks included and a lunch.  snorkelling with lots of fish, swimming, and if you're lucky whale/dolphin watching.

this trip was expensive for us.  prices were comparable to canada for many things.  activities rack up the price.  you can save money on preparing your own meals (especially lunches.  we made wraps).  if you want to eat out on a budget go to sodas.

i recommend the hotel casa roland in san_jose before your flight.  it's a quirky set up with a multitude of art on the walls and sculptures.  good breakfast.  nice staff.  free protected parking.  walls are a little thin, but whatever.  not really a place for walking around because there isn't much to see.   every hotel in this price range is going to have something that is not up to the highest standards.  about 35 minutes from the airport and about 35 minutes from barrio escalante (***depending on traffic) which is a cool restaurant/ bar area that is worth the visit.  not much else to do downtown san_jose to be honest. 

wishing you a great trip!  pura vida!",1,1013

**we used airalo for the whole week and it was very good. i can confirm to anyone wondering that it does use the kolbi network as we hoped, and coverage was near perfect, even in the monteverde mountains. it was our first time using any kind of e-sim so we were apprehensive, and there weren't many reviews of airalo specifically in costa_rica. i hope this helps someone in the future.**",1,92

Trip Review: La Fortuna & Manuel Antonio,"sjo->la_fortuna   

we landed at 12pm in sjo, customs was quick (30 min), and [our driver](http://costaricadriver.net) picked us up outside the exit. lf was about a 3 hour drive without stops. it started to pour and i got carsick but was relieved not to be driving the slippery winding roads.

la_fortuna

arrived at 4pm, stayed 3 nights at an airbnb about 5 min from downtown. no problem with uber, slight wait times but inexpensive. wish we had stayed an extra day. there was so much to do i would‚Äôve been happy staying the whole week. 

activities

club rio multi adventure pass/the springs resort: purchased through [mytanfeet](https://mytanfeet.com/special-deals/club-rio-discount-costa-rica/). definitely the highlight of our trip and worth every penny. includes transport to and from the springs resort where club rio is located, 2 activities (kayaking, rock climbing, tubing, horseback riding, wildlife sanctuary tour), lunch, and a 2 day hot springs pass which we took full advantage of. we had a delicious 3-course meal for lunch. laying in the hot springs after a long day was the perfect way to end our evenings. you can‚Äôt beat the volcano view while having a drink at the swim up bar. 10/10 recommend. ($124)

arenal 1968: we did the shorter hike of the two. the views of arenal lake and volcano were spectacular. i loved the observatory area at the end where you can get some incredible pictures, grab a drink, and take in the 360¬∞ views. ($19)

la_fortuna waterfall: still blown away at how big this was, photos don‚Äôt do it justice. the rocks are slippery, you definitely want to wear water shoes. small locker can be rented for $2 and deposit of $10. it‚Äôs a must see if you‚Äôre physically able. 1000 steps total, i was exhausted by the end. ($18)

food

($15)

rancho club rio restaurant: lunch was in the club rio area on the springs resort property with a beautiful view of the river and great music. we had a 3-course meal; i got a mojito, the trio ceviche, carne casado and tropical fruit mousse parfait. everything was fresh and flavorful. wonderful service and atmosphere.

[pollo fortuneno](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309226-d10238532-reviews-pollo_fortuneno-la_fortuna_de_san_carlos_arenal_volcano_national_park_province_o.html): i got a margarita and arroz con pollo but my friends got octopus. food was pretty good. more expensive than the soda but a cool spot with great drinks in the touristy downtown area. atmosphere was on the louder side but fun. service was ok, they were busy. ($20)

[rio lounge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309226-d7315208-reviews-rio_lounge-la_fortuna_de_san_carlos_arenal_volcano_national_park_province_of_alaj.html): at la_fortuna waterfall. i got a mai tai and sandwich de pollo al pesto, no complaints but nothing to write home about. expensive tourist trap, small portions, not great. ($18)

la_fortuna->manuel antonio

the first half of the drive was pretty bumpy, similar to the first. once on the highway, about halfway, the roads were decent the rest. 5 1/2 hours with stops. we stopped in sarchi at fabrica de carretas eloy alfaro where we saw the original waterwheel with its belts spinning and how oxcarts were traditionally made and painted, super interesting! it‚Äôs a small outdoor factory positioned on a stream and that uses a waterwheel to power the machinery. would‚Äôve never known to stop, big thanks to our driver. we saw some macaw‚Äôs when passing jaco. also, made a stop at the crocodile bridge in tarcoles and got pictures of some crocodiles.

manuel antonio

we stayed at a hotel up on the hill for 3 nights. located in a typical costa_rican neighborhood, friendly dogs running around. by the beach, we saw monkeys, iguanas, and crabs. never needed uber, took advantage of the public bus system, pickup every 20 min and $380 colones per ride.

activities

playa espadilla: beautiful beach with lots going on. plenty of families and dogs, music, soccer, grilling, etc. there‚Äôs boulders on the beach where we saw crabs and other creatures. walked down a bit; grabbed a cabana and three chairs for $20. surfing $25/hour. shaved ice $1500 colones. coconuts with rum $5.

quepos: took the bus down to quepos. checked out marina pez vela. wish we had fished or done a catamaran tour. we walked through the central area, found touristy shops but not much else.

food

[vista verde](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309274-d23212376-reviews-vista_verde_restaurant-manuel_antonio_quepos_province_of_puntarenas.html): felt more of a bar vibe than restaurant. the dip trio appetizer was decent (refried beans, guacamole, salsa with patacones and chips). but the pork tacos had zero flavor.

[emilio‚Äôs cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309274-d3268108-reviews-emilio_s_cafe-manuel_antonio_quepos_province_of_puntarenas.html): best view, up on the hill and facing the pacific. it was the perfect place to begin our first morning. we shared a fruit plate and had coffee. i got the smoked salmon benedict and mimosa. food was fresh and delicious. ($29)

[baldi fresh](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309274-d12267195-reviews-baldi_s_fresh-manuel_antonio_quepos_province_of_puntarenas.html): we stumbled upon this spot at the beach. nice view. public bus is just outside so that‚Äôs convenient. i got a chicken sandwich w fries and a mojito. food was good, service ok. ($19)

[restaurante el cerdo feliz](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309274-d23216860-reviews-restaurante_el_cerdo_feliz-manuel_antonio_quepos_province_of_puntarenas.html): this was closest to our hotel. it‚Äôs an amazing little family owned spot, we dined with them 2 out of 3 nights. i was craving pasta so i got the fettuccine alfredo with ham and mushrooms. the second night i got the azteca soup (chicken tortilla) with avocado chunks, carne fajitas with rice and patacones. a favorite of ours, inexpensive and neighbors to the corner convenient store. absolutely recommend!

cafetto: small cafe in quepos. my friends got coffee and pancakes with fruit. i got a strawberry banana smoothie, fresh flavorful filling. ($3)

[soda sanchez](https://www.tripadvisor.com/restaurant_review-g309289-d953307-reviews-soda_sanchez-quepos_province_of_puntarenas.html): restaurant in quepos. we found it while walking around, great lunch spot. i got the pollo casado. we all enjoyed our food, especially the price. good service. ($7)

manuel antonio->sjo

drive was fine, the smoothest of all trips. departed ma at 7am and arrived sjo at 9:30am, so 2 1/2 hour trip with no stops. grabbed some food at the airport; they had a bakery, burger spot, and a chipotle-like place with different types of bowls. i opted for the burger and fries, typical overpriced airport food.

Trip Report (10 days),"i wanted to share a few highlights, our general itinerary, and a few tidbits we learned from our recent trip to cr in early feb. (10 days total).  we don't enjoy cities and we love driving, hence we covered a fair amount of ground in this trip.

day 1: arrived at sjo after dark, stayed in alajuela

day 2: rental car dropped off. drove to la_fortuna/arenal observatory lodge, stopped at doka coffee for a tour (tour was great, coffee was not), stopped at grocery store in la_fortuna for pb&j sandwich items, we usually had one meal a day that was sandwiches to save money.  also bought any cookies/junk food that looked new and fun.  dinner at aol, very good food, and great sunset (with happy hour drinks).  

day 3:  free morning group hike at aol, went into town later for lunch, didn't do anything really.  

day 4: drove to monteverde by way of rio celeste waterfall.  this detour was definitely out of the way, but so, so worth it.  one of the highlights of our trip.  i was a bit worried about leaving luggage in our car, but we parked front/center almost (by chance) and had no worries. hike was amazing, hot, and take plenty of water if going to the furthest points past the waterfall, which i highly suggest.  wear shoes.  got to monteverde before dark and ate at taco taco.

day 5: ziplined at 100% aventura, loved it, no lines, very well organized.  relaxed rest of day and hiked.  checked out the town a bit and the orchid garden in santa maria.

day 6: drove 5 hours down to ojochal.  road going out of monteverde was much better than the one we took in, this one was newly paved, other one was not paved and very rough.  enjoyable drive, gas is expensive though.

day 7: checked out some local beaches and relaxed at hotel.

day 8: hiked to nauyaca waterfalls (sunday), they were fairly busy but it was well-worth the trek.  tried el fuego brewery afterwards.  sunset near whale's tail.

day 9: made our way back to alajuela, did an afternoon tour of costa_rica meadery and the gardens there after an impromptu email to them that morning.  was another highlight of our trip.

day 10: took back rental car and flew out of sjo. 

some tidbits/useful/surprising things: 

i had originally intended to get a sim card the day after we arrived to be able to use waze and have phone data, but after testing out offline google maps on my phone for car navigation, we decided to skip it, and i don't regret it.  we had wifi every night anyways for whatsapp texting to family back home.  

deet wipes and itch cream were a saving grace after i stupidly forgot to put it on my feet one day and wore sandals.  bugs love me, the no-see-ums got me when we went to la_fortuna for lunch, and i religiously applied deet the rest of the time with no issues.  never saw a mosquito though.

driving was not that bad.  i had a few people gasp in surprise when i said we were renting a car, but we found most roads to be great, and the drivers there are for the most part very courteous, even if they are in a hurry.  getting fuel was painless too, besides the price.  we avoided san_jose on purpose though, so avoided the city traffic.  4-wheel drive was a smart decision.

we loved our visit and although it was an expensive trip for us, it was very much worth it.  we had no issues and found everyone to be really kind and welcoming.",1,614
Is Monteverde worth visiting?!,travelling from tamarindo towards manuel antonio. any advice? or cool places to stop and check out?,1,16
Had our stuff robbed from our car rental‚Ä¶,"hi everyone,  just wanted to to post this as a warning in the hopes that it helps fellow travelers..


we are in the middle of an 18 day vacation to costa_rica,  so far its been a wonderful time.   started in guanacaste and then on la_fortuna.  stayed there for a couple of days and then flipped a coin and decided to try manuel antonio for a few days as the vacation is ending. 


decided to drive there so we rented a car.  its about 5 hours so we stopped in atenas at about the half way mark. found a nice little park and parked the car, locked it and walked a block to grab a baguette from a bakery and came back to the car, ate the snack in the car and went on with our drive.  must have been 5 mins total.  when we got to the hotel in manuel antonio and opened the trunk our luggage was gone.  look in our day back packs and realized the ransacked them, stole our cash, credit cards and ipad and left us with only the clothes on our backs.  

we‚Äôve traveled all over the world and never leave our packs behind.  unfortunately, we let our guard down, maybe just the comfort of having a car that we could lock and lost everything.  weirdly enough they left our passports and drivers license (thank god) so we can at least hop on the plane to leave

just want to give everyone a heads up.  be vigilant‚Ä¶ never leave your stuff unattended or in the car.  should have never stopped, should have just kept driving till we hit the next hotel.  it all happened in the blink of an eye.  we are off to make a police report, for insurance purposes (don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll get any of our stuff back) i had a personal credit card in my pocket so at least we have that.  

that being all said we aren‚Äôt gonna let this one thing ruin the trip.  the people here are beautiful and we have had nothing but a great experience up until this happened.  


we‚Äôll be back again.",1,358
DO NOT Rent From Hertz in CR,"so this is a lesson i learned the hard way.

in the us/canada i'm a regular hertz business renter. naturally i go with hertz for my couple of cr trips this year. both times the rate on the website is a fraction of what i actually get charged thanks to a ton of stupid fees and insurance and prepaid fuel, but whatever, at least i'm getting points.

except i didn't. after a ton of waiting i finally get around to calling hertz just to be told that the cr hertz offices are ""licensees, not corporate hertz locations"" and so they don't pay points.

hertz doesn't warn you of this on their site, and the guys working the desk in cr don't tell you. hertz in cr is hertz in name only, there's not even a common computer system between them. hertz usa will take your booking and send it to hertz cr, but that's the end of it. your rate isn't enforced, your status has no meaning, and there's no points. there's no point to renting with hertz cr, they just cash in on the brand name.

learn from my mistake, don't bother going with a us brand rental agency, they are just local rental desks with a famous name. you may as well save money and use a local rental agent.",1,222

Review of Best driver/ rides in Costa Rica!,"hello and pura vida everyone!! in december 2022, my boyfriend and i decided to go to costa_rica for just a few days and knew we needed to make the most of it. we decided to find a driver / shuttle service because we didn‚Äôt want to deal with the inconvenience of having to navigate foreign roads and directions. 

we found u/arenalrides through this subreddit or maybe the costa_rica one. i texted him on whatsapp ( +506 7170 9978 ) and he responded right away and was super helpful. 

he helped us pick a neighborhood to stay in san_jose for the night and picked us up super early and drove us to la_fortuna. on the way we made multiple stops! he was super willing to stop or take pictures for us as well. he was such a pleasure to have as a driver and a guide. he recommend a white water rafting company to us too and it was the best experience ever. he even checked in on us on the days we didn‚Äôt utilize him to make sure we were okay. 

if you need someone who‚Äôs reliable, hard working and honestly treats you like a friend please book a ride with him! you won‚Äôt regret it!! my boyfriend and i loved having him to guide us and the rides were enjoyable and comfy. thank you so much carlos !! we will definitely contact him when we return.",1,241

My experience - DK to Costa Rica,"here‚Äôs a detailed description of our preparations and journey from denmark to costa_rica. hopefully it can clear up some questions others may have to the three entry requirements: insurance coverage, pcr test and health declaration. i‚Äôm expanding on another account of a journey from the us to cr [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/ifyozk/my_experience_usa_citizen_to_cr_from_uk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

**insurance**

we got our insurance from ins through their online website. we got the cheaper option ‚Äúplan plus‚Äù which came to $381 for two ~30 yo for 77 days, i.e. $190 p.p. or roughly $2.5 p.p. per day. make sure you enter your so as spouse rather than sign up separately to get a small discount. 

the website works poorly with chrome but i found it worked better with internet explorer. 

other  insurance options include sagicor (also costa_rican) with somewhat similar rates. others in this subreddit have entered costa_rica with insurance from [nationwide](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/ifyozk/my_experience_usa_citizen_to_cr_from_uk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) ($60 for 3 months), [allianz](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/j46jww/questions_on_costa_rican_insurance/g7r4huh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) and [safe travels outbound](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/j757b3/example_of_an_approved_international_travel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


**pcr test**

we got ours from the public for free. we were worried we wouldn‚Äôt get our results in time so we also had a fallback booking with a paid 2-hour turnaround service the afternoon before our flight that we ended up not having to use.

we took the test 65 hours before our first leg of our flight (dk -> de), 72 hours before our second leg (de -> cr) and 84 hours before arrival in cr. 

i emailed with the costa_rican tourism department and they confirmed to me that the test must be taken 72 hour prior to the beginning of the journey which in our case was the first leg of our flight from denmark to germany (they confirmed this exact scenario in the email). 

**health declaration**

we filled out the health declaration online the day before our departure. you need to give your seat number information so ideally you wait with filling it out until you have checked in online (if you can, we couldn‚Äôt). for the form you will need:
* personal info (e.g. passport no.)
* address of stay in costa_rica
* entry and departure date
* detailed flight info (both flight number and seat number) for entry
* a pcr test (pdf or like) that you can attach to the form

when we filled out the form we were quite confused by a section that read the pcr test had to be taken ‚Äúmaximum of 12 to 72 hours before‚Äù and then immediately in the next sentence literally read ‚Äúmaximum of 12 to 48 hours before‚Äù. however, only the 12-72 hour part is included in the spanish version and we got in with a 65 hour old test from sample to journey beginning so don‚Äôt worry about this.

at the end you get a qr code you can print out or keep on your phone. 

**the journey**

print out all your documents prior to your journey, i.e.:
* qr code for health declaration
* pcr test result
* insurance policy
* journey details (for proof of exit travel)
* address for where you are staying

we could not check in online with lufthansa. we just got an error message. customer service informed us that this is because entry to cr is restricted for some countries and documents have to be checked at the check-in counters.

we were asked at the lufthansa counter to show our pcr test results already at the first leg of our flight (denmark to germany). i‚Äôm mentioning this since others have reported not having to show it until the final flight to costa_rica and we actually thought it would be the same for us and that we would have some extra hours to potentially get our results if needed, which turned out not to be the case. 

at the second leg in germany they performed a more thorough check that you had your had your documentation in order (negative pcr test, insurance, health declaration qr code) before they allowed you to board. 

when we arrived in costa_rica it was smooth. they were quite tough on us in immigration attitude-wise, but just scanned the qr code and asked me to tell them where i was staying. they did not even look at the pcr-test or the insurance (latter is weird since it‚Äôs not uploaded in the health declaration).",1,716
"8-day itinerary and trip review in December 2022 (La Fortuna, Playas del Coco)","my partner (24f) and i (25m) had a wonderful time in december 2022 in costa_rica despite speaking zero spanish, and i wanted to share our itinerary and experiences in case they might be helpful for anyone. we spent most of the time in la_fortuna, with two days in playas del coco.

a heads-up - we went at a pretty slow pace because we just wanted to take things easy and unwind. for those who want to do more and go faster, you should definitely be able to do so.

we only booked airfare, lodging, and transportation to and from la_fortuna (with carlos) ahead of time; all activities were booked only once we arrived. 

---------------------------------------------------------
**day 1** 

we flew into liberia airport (for those wondering, there *is* free wi-fi at the airport) from toronto in the evening, so we stayed at an airbnb in the nearby community of guardia. this isn't for everyone, but it was very cheap, the host was lovely, and we got to see what life was like for costa_ricans - we were woken up in the morning by roosters, and saw cows and horses on people's properties. 
 
**day 2: arrival at la_fortuna**

carlos (/u/arenalrides), who i had contacted a month earlier on whatsapp to arrange for transportation, picked us up in the morning from our airbnb and drove us to la_fortuna. his english is excellent and he gave us fantastic recommendations for restaurants (soda la hormiga, pollo fortune√±o) and things to do (maquique adventure canyoning, north fields coffee tour) in la_fortuna. he even stopped by a coconut stand on the way and bought us both coconut water :) he is honest, approachable, generous, and a total joy to be with!

we arrived around noon at **hotel arenal xilopalo**. we stayed here for two nights and this might be our favourite place to stay at the entire trip due to its affordable price, cheap activities if you book through them, and excellent restaurant where you can get a fantastic view of the birds near you while you eat breakfast in the morning. my girlfriend shared a review [here](https://goo.gl/maps/zem6gbkazf8rkdtc8).

based on carlos' advice, we had an excellent lunch with delicious smoothies at **pollo fortune√±o**. we then called an uber to spend the afternoon at **volcan arenal ecological park** (tickets booked with our hotel same day; note that this is not an official ecological park, but a private trail at the foot of the volcano. you will not actually go up the volcano).

if you stay at hotel xilopalo, i *highly* recommend doing their sloth tour with armando. it is $20usd per person, far cheaper than you'll find anywhere else, and it also comes with a **night frog walk**. this evening, armando came by our room and spent an hour walking with us around the hotel - we were able to see lots of frogs and lizards!

**day 3**

we had breakfast at the hotel for $6usd per person. at 7am, we got a lovely view of birds that stop by to feed on the bananas put up by the hotel. 

we then joined armando for the **sloth tour**, where we saw 10+ sloths. armando brings a telescope with him and will help you take excellent photos and videos. 

we spent lunch and the afternoon relaxing at **ecotermales hot springs**, then spent the evening walking around the town of la_fortuna.

**day 4**

per carlos' recommendation, we enjoyed a traditional casado breakfast at **soda la hormiga**. for the afternoon, we did canyoning with **maquique adventures** (we booked this with hotel xilopalo for $75usd per person - cheaper than we could find anywhere else). the activity included transportation, a delicious lunch, and an amazing experience ziplining and rappelling through the rainforest and down waterfalls. if you haven't done it before, i highly recommend it. bring water shoes because you *will* get completely soaked.

in the evening, we moved to **arenal oasis eco lodge** on the outskirts of la_fortuna, where we get a cabin to ourselves in the rainforest for the next two nights.

**day 5**

arenal oasis eco lodge comes with a free breakfast, where we were also able to enjoy lots of birds and wildlife feeding just 10 feet away from you. we spent the morning exploring the trails of the property, where we spotted hummingbirds, crested guans, great currasows, motmots, clay-coloured thrush, and a variety of other gorgeous birds. 

in the afternoon, we went to **mistico arenal hanging bridges**. it's a lovely walk and a big tourist attraction, but we didn't feel it was necessarily worth the price. we did see coatis (aka central american raccoons) and two pit vipers by the trail, pointed out by tour guides we passed by.
 
**day 6: arrival at playas del coco**

we were woken up at 4:30am by demonic moans - turns out they were howler monkeys in the trees nearby lol. it's one of the cool things about living in the rainforest! 

after free breakfast at arenal oasis eco lodge, carlos drove us to **playas del coco**. we stayed at another airbnb in town. we spent the afternoon on the beach, in the ocean, then walked around the tiny main street. we considered a sunset cruise or some water activities today, but instead decided to just relax for the afternoon. 

**day 7**
we spent this entire day at **diamante adventure eco park**. this is expensive ($135 usd per person with tax; i found promo code ""howler"" online that gave us 10% off) but includes one of costa_rica's longest ziplines, an animal sanctuary (including sloth feeding!), a free buffet, a coffee and chocolate experience, and a private beach. we would recommend this for someone who wants to do a lot of stuff in a single day, with so many experiences curated for you together.

**day 8**
we took things easy in the morning, had lunch in town, then flew home to toronto in the early afternoon. we decided to take the hourly public bus from coco to liberia airport, which only cost ~$3 for the two of us.


**things we brought that were helpful:**

* bug spray (this is comically expensive in costa_rica, and you *will* encounter mosquitos in la_fortuna. remember to pack small bottles or else you may not be able to board your flight with it)
* sunscreen (protect your skin y'all)  
* umbrella
* sturdy hiking shoes
* shampoo (somehow, none of the places we stayed at provided them - only shower gel/soap)  
* water shoes (very helpful if you do water activities and/or canyoning)  
* binoculars (we got some cheap ones for $30 - they were somewhat helpful for seeing some animals up in the trees!)

**a few tips:**

* we got around fine with just usd. we did not bring or exchange for any colones while there. most places (even small sodas) will take credit card - i recommend using one that doesn't have foreign exchange fees.

* uber is widely available in la_fortuna, and somewhat in coco. however, if you go somewhere decently far from town (e.g., mistico hanging bridges from la_fortuna, diamante from playas del coco), finding an uber back late in the day may be difficult. i found it helpful to ask the uber driver on my way there if i could get their whatsapp number, so they could drive me back in exchange for cash. carlos, our private driver, knows tons of drivers across costa_rica and can also help you find a ride free of charge.",1,1257
Making Friends in Costa Rica?,"hello!

my name is elisabeth, and i'm planning on doing a solo travel adventure to costa_rica this december! i'm 29 from the u.s., and am curious about how easy it is to make friends/date in the country? are there a good amount of fellow millennial travelers/digital nomads? if so, any advice in regard to meeting people would be awesome!

Just Finished our Family Trip to Costa Rica and it was a Blast!!!,"just spend 9 days with friends and family touring bijagua and at the riu palace in guanacaste. we rented a van which was about $1,175 from payless car rentals in san_jose. it was fun driving through costa_rica and wasn‚Äôt too hard for a driver from the usa. we spent 3 days at the heliconias rainforest lodge in bijagua. it rains heavily there but we did get to tube down the rio celeste, do night hikes, frog tours, and the hanging bridges which i highly recommend.  we did get rained out on the day we were supposed to go on our white water rafting trip but i was grateful our tour guide canceled the trip and put safety ahead of profits since we had little kids. luckily, he was able find us a tour at a sloth sanctuary which was cool too. overall if you‚Äôre down to get dirty the heliconias rainforest lodge is a great idea. the staff is also friendly and accommodating and helped get us in touch with local tour guides.

the next part of our trip was spent at the all inclusive resort the riu palace. my god the place is fantastic and was great for relaxing. you can pretty much book everything you want at the hotel but we went to coco beach and saved money in chartering a boat for a family fishing trip! my son caught his first fish and it was awesome being there for it. we also spent time doing atv rides at the diamant√© eco adventure park and lounging by the pools and water park. this is a wonderful place with live entertainment and decent food and i would absolutely go back here if i had 5 days to get away.

overall, costa_rica was a wonderful experience for my family and friends and i hope you can get some ideas from my post. every bit of this trip was pulled from reading other people‚Äôs reviews from this thread so hopefully you can find something helpful as well. pura vida!",1,341
Tamarindo is not as bad as people make it out to be.,"tamarindo was my last town i visited. i went in knowing i was going to hate it. and after about 3 days i liked it. stayed an extra 3 days. 

yes it is touristy but so was most of the cities down the coast. 

i know i'm not explaining things in a thoughtful way but there is only one way to find out. and that is to see for yourself. dont have time, cool. but seriously take people's advice with a gain of salt. even mine. 

every city has pros and cons. and everyone thoughts on what is touristy is different. 

tamarindo was touristy, slightly more expensive but i found a stellar deal for accommodations. the beach is fine and i like it better than samara. the food options were plentiful and some were cheap and good. what more do you want?

maybe covid and rainy season played a role in me liking tamarindo. who knows but i went and had a decent time. 

i recommend hotel mar rey for 50usd private rooms. wild panda for casino and chifrito. anthony for sushi. sharky for some partying on the weekend. i recommend the sunset on the beach around 5:30. there is a lady that sells food out of her car around noon by the hotel. bring your own tupperware. 

cons: there is lots of construction everywhere. buildings and roads! this started 2 days ago. you have been warned. groceries and stuff are expensive most expensive out of the peninsula. but you get use to it as you get closer you get to tamarindo. 

tips: get a car and get to the next local town villareal and buy stuff. in montezuma and santa teresa go to cordabo and buy stuff.

Do not Use Ace Rent a Car in San Jose,"one word of advice do not use ace rental car at san_jose airport. they stole our money and ruined our trip. do not let this happen to you.

i want to add i have been to costa_rica more than 20 times and rented cars on almost every trip. it is normally fun and easy. 

last christmas we paid in advance for a car. 

when we arrived at ace (with kids after 11 hours of flying) they had no cars for us, laughed at us, after hours of waiting they ignored us and told us to leave their store. 

we were stranded in the middle of the night with no hotel, no car, no shuttle, and no options. they then lied to our credit card company and said they gave us a car and stole our money, which was over $2,000 usd. 

edit:
people have asked why i didn‚Äôt contact my credit card company and dispute the charge. we had planned well in advance of this trip and prepaid the car 3 months before our arrival. my credit card company (amex) gives you 90 days to protest a charge before it is cleared. when we landed it had been 91 days and, because of how long it had been since the ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù or prepayment of the rental we weren‚Äôt able to dispute.",1,223

Trip Report December 10 - 17,"this sub has really been invaluable to me over the last 12+ months as i've lurked and used the guidance here to plan a recent trip to costa_rica.  i thought i'd try to repay the favor by providing a write-up, in the hopes it helps anyone else looking for advice or suggestions. 

**weather**

* the weather was fantastic the week we were there.  the only day we had rain was friday 12/16 on our drive from dominical back to san_jose, but even that was brief and didn't present any issues.  every other day was sunny and warm.

**driving**

* we booked a suzuki vitara with vamos and they were perfect to work with.  they were very responsive leading up to the trip and incredibly helpful with picking us up and dropping us off at the airport.  they even let us change the rental at the last minute and refunded us the cost for reducing the duration by a day.
* be prepared for lots of winding narrow roads, especially driving to/from la_fortuna.  the main route we took from san_jose included driving through several small towns.  there aren't sidewalks in many of these places, and residents often walk on the sides of the road.  also there are a lot of dogs that tend to run along the side of the road - we were happy to survive the trip without having any accidents with them.
* i found driving to be a bit challenging coming from a fairly large metro area in the us.  other costa_rican drivers were largely very courteous, but many locals preferred to exceed the speed limit (i maxed out around 10 kph over) and would often pass us even on a double yellow two-lane road.
* the speed limit changes frequently, and can require a lot of vigilance if you're trying to stay within the max limit.  rather than road signs marking changes, it was painted on the road.
* bring your patience.  driving times between areas were often 30-60 minutes more than the apps (google maps or waze) would estimate.  there were a number of instances of road construction, or repairs from mudslides that had road closures lasting up to 30 minutes.  it also wasn't uncommon to get stuck behind a large truck going 10-15 kph on a small winding road through the mountains.
* we had the most issues driving in and around the san_jose area.  driving back into the capital from the west coast (dominical) on friday afternoon was pretty rough with lots of traffic and delays.
* gas stations are full service in costa_rica.

**food**

* we loved the food throughout our trip and didn't have a bad meal.  our favorite restaurants around la_fortuna served comida tipica, or local costa_rican staples.  i ordered the casado at many of the restaurants which included rice and beans, a protein, a small salad and some other sides (mashed yucca, pickled veggies, etc.) and these were all fantastic.  there were other restaurants that provided different cuisines or catered to the tastes of american tourists, but we didn't enjoy those as much.
* the food in the dominical area was much more varied (and more expensive) than la_fortuna.  we ate fish as much as possible and really enjoyed the different dining options here.
* tipping - every receipt we received did include a 10% service charge, but i always tipped an additional 5-10% on top of that.
* we found the process for asking for the check at the end of the meal a bit confusing, but ultimately learned that in most cases you just go up to the counter and pay there.  we spent a fair amount of time waiting for wait staff to bring the check to our table, but that doesn't seem to be how things typically work.

**itinerary**

**saturday december 10**

* our flight was an hour late and didn't get in until around 9:30pm.  after having cr immigration review our passports, we collected our bags, got some colones out of the atm by baggage claim, and then proceeded to the bag scan line where they scan your luggage for banned items (agricultural, animal).  this line was long and took about 30 mins.
* once you leave the airport there's a flurry of activity and people asking if you need a ride.  vamos picked us up, drove us back to their agency and facilitated the car rental even though we were late.  we spent the night in the hampton by hilton right across from vamos, which was fine for our purposes.

**sunday december 11**

* woke up early and drove to la_fortuna.  gps said 2.5 hours but it was closer to 3+.
* on the way stopped at the la_fortuna waterfall.  really beautiful waterfall and swimming area at the bottom of 580+ steps.  you will get a workout on the way back up!
* drove into la_fortuna and had a nice lunch at soda viquez.
* checked into our hotel - el silencio del campo.  this hotel was incredible, included a wonderful breakfast each morning, and was comprised of 24 villas throughout the grounds.  it was well manicured, the staff were friendly and very helpful.  it has a working farm on site, a spa, 3 hot springs pools, 2 cold pools and a jacuzzi.  there is a bar in the hot springs area and everything was pretty empty the entire time we were there.  the most people we ever saw in the hot springs area was maybe 5.  can't recommend it enough.
* did the bogarin sloth trail, unguided, and saw multiple sloths including a mother with a baby attached that climbed to the ground for her weekly poop.  this was awesome.
* dinner was at the hotel, which was fine but unremarkable.

**monday december 12**

* drove to skyadventure arenal for a reservation for a hiking tour, tram and ziplining.  saw a few coati along the side of the ride on the drive. the hiking tour was guided and took about 1.5 hrs through their trails in the forest.  this was fine, but i wouldn't go out of your way.
* the tram and the zipline were really phenomenal.  this was my first time and i have a bit of a concern about heights, but the views from the top of the tram were insanely gorgeous.  the guides on the zipline were really helpful and worked with you through all 7 ziplines.  highly recommended.
* dinner at pollo fortuneno.  this felt like a restaurant picked up from a metro area in the us and dropped in la_fortuna.  the chicken was fine, the service was not great, and ultimately we preferred the smaller local spots to restaurants like this targeted at tourists.
* after dinner we grabbed drinks at a bar called voodoo in a small food hall called mercadito arenal.  the drinks and presentation were good and a nice way to cap the night.

**tuesday december 13**

* we had reservations for the rio balsa (class ii/iii) rapids with desafio adventures.  this was another incredibly well-run operation that i can't recommend enough.
* desafio picked us up from our hotel and took us back to their property while we waited for other guests who went canyoneering earlier that morning.  while waiting we went through their private entrance to the el salto river area, complete with a rope swing.  saw some howler monkeys in the trees overhead, and they provided coffee and restrooms.
* took about a 30-45 minute drive out to the drop-in point along the rio balsa.  they provided the gear, instructions on rafting and then we started down the river.  this was really very fun, and we felt safe.  halfway through we pulled over on the side of the river for a tropical fruit snack.  at the end we were able to change out of our wet clothes before a 30 min ride back to their property for a free lunch buffet.  again, this was fantastic.
* that afternoon we strolled through the main square in la_fortuna which was decorated with christmas lights, and did some shopping.  dinner was at the rainforest cafe, which was great.

**wednesday december 14**

* woke up and started the drive to dominical.  gps quoted it as 5.5 hours but it was closer to 6.5 with traffic.  be prepared for a full day getting between lf and the coast.
* stopped at the crocodile bridge outside of tarcoles, and got some pics of huge crocs.  had lunch at vista mar, which was really good but a bit pricy given the location across from the beach access.
* we checked into the mavi surf hotel, where we stayed for 2 nights in dominical.  this is an 8-room motel style building run by an italian couple who were incredibly friendly and helpful.  the rooms are clean, but a bit spartan (no tvs) and lacked some amenities (bring hair conditioner).  there's a great pool in the common area, and they offer breakfast every morning as well.  it's a shortl 5 minute walk to the dominical beach, but we arrived shortly after a rain storm so the road had a lot of potholes filled with mud and water so we ended up driving down during our stay.  overall it was a great place, but just know what to expect going in.  it's a place to lay your head with friendly owners and great access to the major amenity in dominical, the coastline.
* we enjoyed some beach time before having dinner at phat noodle which was really delicious.

**thursday december 15**

* we drove to nauyaca falls ([this one](http://nauyacawaterfallscostarica.com/)), paid the entry and parking fees and then began the 2.5mi hike towards the falls.  this was not an easy hike, with a number of elevation gains without a lot of shade.  definitely bring water/hat/sunscreen.  once you get to the falls they're really an amazing sight and worth the effort.  there are two viewing platforms and then access to the pool at the bottom of the lower falls for swimming.  the water is cold, and the rocks are slippier so bring appropriate footwear.  we got to the falls by 10:30am and it wasn't very crowded but continued to fill up throughout the hour we stayed.
* lunch back in dominical at el pescado loco.  this outdoor counter-service fish shop is a bit hard to locate, but we thoroughly enjoyed our tacos here.
* after some beach time, we had dinner at fuego brewing.  this was the busiest place we ate at during our trip but there were seats at the bar available.  the restaurant is very cool, tucked away into the forest and accessed by a boardwalk.  great ceviche, fish tacos, and solid beer (and seltzer).

**friday december 16**

* we booked a guided kayak and sup tour with pineapple tours through the mangroves.  met at the supermarket outside dominical around 7:30am and followed the tour guides in our own car to the drop-in point near matapalo.  the last 15 mins of this drive were on a one-lane dirt road that was fairly overgrown - recommend you have a vehicle with a decent amount of clearance and our suzuki was fine.
* our group split into two and had a guide taking us through different channels along the rio portalon until it meets the rio savegre, and ultimately out to the mouth of the rivers along the beach.  we saw crabs, snails, a capuchin monkey, snakes and learned a ton about the ecosystem.  definitely a more informational tour, but still had a great time and the guides were excellent.  tropical fruit was provided at the end of the tour, and they showed us some sloths in trees along the road when leaving.
* we had lunch at la junta dominical which was also delicious, and then began the drive back to san_jose.
* after a long traffic-filled drive, we arrived at the courtyard by marriott near the san_jose to stay before our flight out early the next morning.

**summary**

* la_fortuna was incredible and i felt like we could have spent a few more days there.
* dominical was a really cute town with a fun expat/surfer/hippie vibe.  the beach was nice, with warm water, but could be a bit rougher.  the sand had a lot of rocks that you had to avoid when walking/laying down but we really enjoyed our time there as well.
* if/when we go back i'd want to spend more time in the la_fortuna area to explore the volcan tenorio, and navigate to other areas on the west coast (guanacaste).  from everything guides and locals told us, if you're doing la_fortuna then you really don't need to also see monteverde in the same trip, as they offer a lot of the same experiences",1,2147

My travel experience from Canada to CR,"flew out from toronto airport (yyz) to san_jose (sjo) airport today. 

checked in at 6:30am for 8:30am departure, i ended up waiting about 25 minutes to check in. air canada checked your insurance before they allowed you to check in, along with your qr code (for the health form). if you didn't have either they wouldn't let you check in. total time from check-in to getting to the boarding gate was 45 minutes.

the flight was absolutely full by the way to cr.

arrived at sjo walked passed some camera, i believe it was a thermal camera of sorts. walked to immigration and waited 20 minutes there to get to the booth. at the booth they asked for my qr code and the address i will be staying at along with my occupation. they didn't ask for insurance, i guess they saw i got insurance through sagicor. other people who had their own insurance had to get it checked in a seperate line i believe i overheard.

other than that passport stamped and i waited 25 minutes for my luggage. from start to finish was about 45 minutes. i got lucky i was infront of the immigration line, 2 flights landed after me and the line got super long. i would recommend getting a seat closer to the front of the plane if possible.

the airport is definitely picking up quite a bit.",1,234
My experience - USA citizen to CR from UK,"feel free to ask any questions!

- stayed 15 days in the united kingdom. trouble free entrance, quarantined for 14 days, did a rapid pcr test, traveled from london heathrow - frankfurt germany via lufthansa
- in germany at the flight gate they check your qr code from costa_rica‚Äôs epidemiological form 
- chill 12 hour flight from germany to san_jose. roomy, everyone had a whole row, blanket & pillow, tvs, fed you 3 times plus tea, water, alcohol


arrival to sjo : 
could‚Äôve went smoother, but this is all new so of course they don‚Äôt have it seamless yet. 
- waited in line to go through customs, then they scanned my qr code and transferred me to another area..was weird to be honest. in that room they checked my international insurance (i guess if you use cr insurance you won‚Äôt have to do this)
- asked for proof of who/where i was staying. i‚Äôm not staying at a hotel so i didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreservation‚Äù. my friend here had to send a statement saying i‚Äôm staying with them // then emailed that to an official cr person
- waited in line again to go through customs. agent checked my insurance again (wasn‚Äôt that the point of the other room!?!) asked to see my covid test, how long i was staying, profession. stamped & on my way!!!
- did not ask for proof of an exit flight, but always good to have one as ‚Äúbackup‚Äù to show in case
- wasn‚Äôt alarmed at me being usa citizen 

insurance -  nationwide
$60 for 3 months. 25 years old. minimum $50k coverage. cr‚Äôs was $200. just googled international travel insurance and went through some generated form - picked the cheapest and compliant with cr. 

*** my biggest tip : have all your forms printed. covid test, insurance, reservation/statement from friend. 

all in all fine experience getting in. i would recommend it, everyone is very kind and i believe it‚Äôs a safe & wonderful place to be as far as international travel goes right now. happy to be welcomed in, stoked the border is open!

Hope everyone over there is doing ok and a belated thank you,"i got back just over a week ago - so incredible timing on my part,  it is chaos back here like everywhere, major changes daily but my memories of such a fantastic holiday are keeping me sane.  thank you to all the people on here who gave advice.  i only visited a tiny number of places so i definitely would like to return one day.",1,65
Two-week Trip Review and Itinerary - 8th - 20th December,"i will just start off by saying this will be very long and detailed as i really appreciated having lots of info before i travelled, but **tl;dr ‚Äì went to tortuguero, la_fortuna, playa potrero / flamingo and monteverde, i had the best time ever and if you‚Äôre planning a trip to cr for the first time then i‚Äôm already jealous of you**. i‚Äôll start with our itinerary and follow up with some general thoughts/tips. 

**some background**
we‚Äôre a couple from the uk, both 35, no kids and never been to central / south america. we never have a particularly big budget and are always looking for value rather than luxury, but don‚Äôt do things on a total shoestring. neither of us speak much spanish but i did some duolingo for a few weeks beforehand which was actually great as an intro to the basics and i used what i learned a lot. we didn‚Äôt hire a car and mostly used pre-booked shared shuttles.

**itinerary**

**8 december ‚Äì san_jose**
* mostly spent on a plane from london to san_jose. 
* we got into san_jose about 4.30pm and went to check-in at our hotel **casa maria aeropuerto** in rio segundo, very nearby, about 5 minutes in a taxi. i can fully recommend this great hotel for an airport-adjacent stopover - $64 for one night. 
* we were a bit confused about taxis when we got out of the airport ‚Äì if you‚Äôre looking for one to take you somewhere local, *turn left* as soon as you get out of customs, there should be guys with clipboards organising people into the local orange taxi cabs.
* we ate delicious and cheap ceviche and a mixed seafood casado at a local cevichera for dinner. 

**9 december - tortuguero**
* we organised transport to and from tortuguero through **jungle tom safaris** which went super smoothly and was $70pp each way ‚Äì they picked us up at 6.30am from our hotel and drove us to la pavona, where we were met by a rep from our hotel and shown to a boat, which left immediately for tortuguero. 
* we were dropped off about 11.30 directly at our hotel, **casa marbella**, which was fantastic with a beautiful terrace looking onto the lagoon and great breakfast every morning, and right on the main ‚Äòroad‚Äô through town - $90 for two nights.
* in the afternoon we wandered to the beach and happened to see some baby sea turtles leaving the nest and running to the sea! a total highlight of the trip, an experience which we shared with just a couple of other people who happened to be there, and which i won‚Äôt forget. 
* we went on a guided night walk of the local forest, organized through the hotel, this was brilliant and we saw so many amazing creatures ‚Äì snakes, insects, birds, sloths, lizards ‚Äì we were the only people on the tour - $25pp, 2.5 hours.
* ate a late dinner at budda caf√©, great food and delicious cocktails, the place has quite a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô touristy feel with relatively higher prices but very nice. 

**10 december ‚Äì tortuguero**
* morning river tour organised through hotel, 5.50am - $25pp plus you need to book a $15pp ticket to the national park in advance online (can be used for the full day). this was an incredible introduction to the waterways of tortuguero. we saw howler monkeys, spider monkeys, sloths, herons, iguanas, caimans, toucans, green macaws, and learned so much about this beautiful part of costa_rica and its wildlife and history. even if you don‚Äôt stay at casa marbella, see if you can book this tour with them, it was wonderful and lasted just over 3 hours. 
*relaxed morning wandering about tortuguero village (it‚Äôs really just one road with the lagoon on one side and the beach on the other, but lots of great little cafes, shops and restaurants to explore) had a traditional caribbean casado at soda dona maria, with coconut rice and beans and grilled chicken.
*walked the tortuguero national park trail ourselves, then walked back along the beach, about two hours in total ‚Äì saw some wildlife but i imagine you‚Äôd see more with a guide. it was a great walk all the same, and we found skeletons on the beach from nesting green turtles that had been attacked by jaguars (our guide from the night walk had suggested we take a look ‚Äì very interesting). 
*dinner was at taylor‚Äôs place ‚Äì really atmospheric and great food by candlelight but felt a bit weird as we were the only customers, the service was great but prices quite high. went back to budda caf√© for cocktails. 

**11 december ‚Äì tortuguero to la_fortuna**
* we got the boat we had been advised to get by the hotel rep at 8.45am, and were met at la pavona by the same driver we‚Äôd arrived with ‚Äì on time, friendly and got us to la_fortuna for about 1.30pm ‚Äì again it was $70pp paid in cash on the day. 
* checked into hotel arenal xilopalo, a large hotel on the edge of town (5 minutes‚Äô walk to downtown) with amazing views of the volcano and very helpful staff - $157 for four nights. really good value hotel, breakfast was $5 and fully recommended as they put fruit out for the birds so you can watch them while you eat. the breakfast was extremely good, choice of gallo pinto with eggs, waffles/pancakes, or omelette. came with a plate of fresh fruit as did every breakfast we had in cr.
* explored town, booked tours for next few days through hotel, and had dinner at a great peruvian restaurant - *chifa la familia feliz*. 

**12 december ‚Äì la_fortuna**
* in the morning we took an uber to la_fortuna waterfall, walked the 500 steps down to the fall and swam / paddled in the water ‚Äì we were there a couple of hours then got an uber back. really beautiful and a great experience ‚Äì water is quite cold but refreshing, and definitely bring water shoes for this one. 
* in the afternoon we went on the sloth walking tour with armando, who works with the hotel ‚Äì there were three of us on the tour and we saw sloths, iguanas, birds, frogs and insects ‚Äì armando has a fantastic eye for spotting them, and helped us take some amazing photos through his telescope ‚Äì tour was $20pp including an evening walking tour in the grounds of the hotel. 
* dinner was at an italian restaurant in downtown called la forchetta ‚Äì it had great reviews but we found it only ok. not bad value and you can design whatever pizza you like, but i‚Äôd rather have gone somewhere more costa_rican on reflection. 
* that evening we met back up with armando for an evening wildlife tour in the hotel grounds, about half an hour ‚Äì saw frogs, lizards, bats, again he was absolutely genius at spotting things.

**13 december ‚Äì la_fortuna**
* full day tour to rio celeste, booked through hotel - $60pp. picked up at hotel, on the way we stopped a few times to see wildlife, tour guide was excellent and rio celeste was absolutely beautiful ‚Äì hot and sunny when we went so it was super blue and clear ‚Äì tour included transport, guided hike, traditional lunch at a local restaurant and opportunity to swim in the blue water nearby (you can‚Äôt swim in the actual volcan tenorio national park). really good value, you can do rio celeste yourself if you have your own transport and i would say you don‚Äôt need a guide, but good value as a package if you don‚Äôt have a car. 
* dinner at spectacolar in downtown la_fortuna ‚Äì excellent tacos and margaritas, we loved this place ‚Äì again fairly touristy but good quality mexican food which is rare for us in the uk. 

**14 december ‚Äì la_fortuna**
* **north fields coffee and chocolate tour**, booked through hotel - $33pp, transport included. only about ten minutes from la_fortuna, great tour with informative guide and lots of opportunity to taste chocolate, coffee and sugar cane and learn a lot about the process and the history / culture of coffee both around the world and in costa_rica. really enjoyed this, it was relaxed and a nice way to spend a sunny morning. 
* we booked a day pass for **tabacon hot springs** weeks in advance and spent the afternoon there ‚Äì it was heaven. we were there around 3pm ‚Äì 7pm, lazed in the pools, drank (expensive!) cocktails at the swim-up bar. real high quality experience, this was a bit of a ‚Äòsplurge‚Äô for us and we were so pleased we spent the extra money. got an uber there and back, you can rent a towel and locker inside for a deposit and the bar takes card/contactless. $80pp entry, $6 a beer and $16 a cocktail. 
* dinner was at yellow bark in la_fortuna for incredibly good value burgers. 

**15 december ‚Äì la_fortuna to potrero**
* interbus shared shuttle picked us up from hotel and took us to our hotel in potrero on the pacific coast, quite a long journey as we had to switch buses halfway but all on time and great driver, with a stop at limonal to switch and use the bathroom, have food etc. 
* checked into **surfside mar-y-posa**, beautiful oasis-like place ten minutes from the beach, four rooms with a shared pool and outside cooking / eating facilities ‚Äì very laid back vibe, a bit more like staying at an airbnb than a hotel but owner was always around if we needed her - $169 for two nights. 
* lunch at the shack, great laid back place with excellent food
* wandered to the beach, watched the sunset and then went to potrero brewing company‚Äôs microbrewery and taproom, where we had some beers and some tacos from their street food stall in the garden ‚Äì fantastic craft beer, the food was ok. all of these places were within 10 minutes of our accommodation.

**16 december ‚Äì potrero / playa flamingo**
* i had a very chilled morning by / in the pool while my partner scuba dived from playa flamingo ‚Äì he was really pleased with this, and although he didn‚Äôt see manta rays (his goal) he did see devil rays which he says were *almost* as good‚Ä¶
* walked to the north side of potrero, which is much more costa_rican than surfside, the southern part - ate delicious chifrijo from a soda on the main square, then wandered back along the beach (only doable when the tide‚Äôs out)
* we got an uber to playa flamingo and ate dinner at coco loco on the beach while watching the sun set ‚Äì one of the best dinner experiences of the trip, no bookings taken but we got a table fine, food and cocktails were fantastic and surprisingly good value for the quality and location. took the recommendation from someone on this sub who lives in flamingo so thank you! 

**17 december ‚Äì potrero to monteverde**
* walked to playa penca along the beach, about half an hour ‚Äì tide had come in so this involved wading through waist-high water at one point with our backpacks over our heads, luckily had my bikini on!
* lazed at playa penca, beautiful white sand beach but quite a vicious rip tide, i‚Äôm not a strong swimmer so i just paddled and sunbathed 
* interbus shuttle in the afternoon to monteverde ‚Äì about three hours including loo break, really challenging twisty unpaved roads for a lot of this, the driver was a total pro and the views were spectacular ‚Äì but pleased with our decision not to rent a car! 
* checked into **cala lodge** in monteverde in the evening, a little outside of santa elena (20 minutes walk, downhill on the way in and steep uphill on the way back, taxis $4 and easy to get in santa elena or hotel can call you one) ‚Äì great breakfast included with stunning views, and an amazing nature trail around the grounds where you can see coatis, agouties, capuchin monkeys, mot mots - $261 for three nights. 

**18 december ‚Äì monteverde**
* **el tigre waterfalls hike** - honestly one of the highlights of our whole trip, this place is a really slick operation ‚Äì we did the full package for $59pp plus $10 for hotel pick-up and drop-off. this included self-guided hike, it was pretty challenging but super fun with lots of rope bridges and tricky terrain, but it was totally doable. then there are horses to take you back up to the entrance, which i loved ‚Äì i‚Äôve never ridden a horse before and it was such a great experience. we had pre-ordered lunch before we set off so this was ready for us when we got back to base, we had the option to wait a little bit or to eat straight away. delicious food with a choice of different traditional dishes ‚Äì we had chifrijo and a fried fish casado, both fantastic. can‚Äôt recommend this package enough if you‚Äôre in monteverde ‚Äì exceptional. 

* back to hotel for 1pm and a wander down to santa elena, dinner at the spectacolar monteverde branch ‚Äì we tried to get into taco taco but it was packed out, this place was just down the road and empty and we enjoy tacos and quesadillas here. not as popular as the la_fortuna branch but just as good. 

**19 december ‚Äì monteverde**
* **selvatura hanging bridges** - we just did the self-guided walk with the bridges ‚Äì a great way to spend a couple of hours, the price felt a bit steep for what it is ($45) ‚Äì i would maybe have been happy to pay $30pp for this. we briefly spotted a quetzal which was exciting! but not much else in terms of wildlife, it feels like perhaps the large amount of tourists doesn‚Äôt help that. 
* another relaxed afternoon in santa elena buying presents to take home, beers at bar amigos which looks like a total dive from outside but is surprisingly big and nice inside with great views 
* dinner at the green in santa elena, fantastic value steak and red wine, a really good choice for our final costa_rica dinner. 

**20 december ‚Äì monteverde to home :(**
* picked up by interbus and driven to sjo airport to start the long journey back to london ‚Äì more spectacular views at the beginning and lots of traffic coming into san_jose but got there in plenty of time

**general thoughts / tips**

**tipping** - there‚Äôs lots of chat around tipping on here ‚Äì we‚Äôre from the uk so we‚Äôre totally used to having 10% service included and not giving any more ‚Äì which is exactly what we did here. don‚Äôt feel like you have to give anymore. as someone from a country with an identical tipping culture, give what you like but know that it is absolutely not expected for you to go above and beyond. 

**weather** - perhaps we were very lucky but it only rained three times on our whole trip, once heavily while we were on the boat to tortuguero (it had rain covers so no problem), once lightly and briefly in tortuguero national park, and once lightly and briefly during our el tigre hike in monteverde. always took waterproofs with us when out but we mostly enjoyed blue skies and hot weather throughout, despite everyone in la_fortuna telling us it was rainy season! we had clear views of arenal most days ‚Äì spectacular. 

**shared shuttles** - can‚Äôt overstate how much i recommend using interbus ‚Äì they were on time every single time, the drivers were total professionals and got us places in pretty much the exact time google maps stated, explained when we would be stopping for a break beforehand, incredibly pleasant experience. clean and new buses with wi-fi and air-con, can‚Äôt fault them. around $60-70pp per trip so not cheap, but worth every penny.

**currency** - we almost exclusively paid in colones, i‚Äôve stated prices in $ here for clarity but it made no sense for us to convert to dollars as we‚Äôre not from the us. however everywhere we went was accepting of both dollars and colones and most places accepted card. important to note that **tortuguero has no atms** and our hotel and transport only accepted cash so we made sure to take lots of cash there with us ‚Äì lots of the restaurants and shops there accept card though. 

**roads** - we didn‚Äôt hire a car and i‚Äôve got to say we‚Äôre glad we didn‚Äôt, i didn‚Äôt feel inconvenienced by that and it was a relief to have experienced costa_rican drivers doing the work for us. ubers were easy to get in la_fortuna and potrero and cheap. technically not legal but they exist everywhere touristy pretty much. easier to get an uber in cr than in the uk at the moment! roads were a mix, some were paved and normal, some absolutely full of shocking potholes, drivers overtaking on bends, etc. plenty of people hire cars with no problem but not for me, especially factoring in that i‚Äôm used to driving a manual on the left hand side of the road!

**sim card** - picked them up from the claro stand in the baggage hall at sjo for $20 each, 5gb with unlimited whatsapp. lasted perfectly for the whole trip and we had good reception most places. 

**summary**
* tortuguero was magical ‚Äì like nowhere i‚Äôve ever been before, i would recommend it to anybody whether or not it‚Äôs turtle nesting season (it wasn‚Äôt when we went), and doing the caribbean coast and the pacific coast in one trip was so worth it and not at all too much as some had suggested. 
* la_fortuna needs time to see everything on offer, we stayed four nights but could easily have stayed longer, so many things to see and do ‚Äì don‚Äôt give it less than three nights. 
* we mostly went to potrero / flamingo for the scuba diving, but i loved the super chilled vibe and it came at the perfect time for us after quite a hectic schedule in la_fortuna ‚Äì great option for a relaxed break in your trip. 
* monteverde was not like anywhere else we went, i‚Äôve seen others say you don‚Äôt have to do both monteverde and la_fortuna but for me they were very different ‚Äì the climate, the atmosphere, the wildlife and the general way of life felt like two very different places. 

i‚Äôll probably think of some more stuff that i‚Äôve forgotten, somehow, despite this being an essay, but if anyone has any questions then shoot away.",1,3163
So I really messed this up ...,"i wanted to take my family of 4 to costa_rica over christmas as my wife and i have both been and enjoyed it quite a lot.

i booked tickets in september from toronto to san_jose and it was not until last week that we caught our mistake.

toronto to san_jose international airport.....in san_jose california.

my fault completely, i should have paid more attention to the booking.

i had booked with air canada and the best they can do is re-book for $6,0000 more or give us a travel voucher for the original $4,000.

i think i will take the voucher and use for a later trip as it won't be issued until 6 weeks.

does anyone have a suggestion on other airlines or possible seat sales for the 24th to jan 6th or are we better to wait until next year or the summer?

thanks for your help!",1,152
"14-Day Trip Report: La Fortuna, Monteverde and Manuel Antonio","hi all, i got back from 14 days on tuesday and wanted to share my trip report since i found others‚Äô so helpful. for context, i‚Äôm in my late 20s, from nyc, frequent traveler. 

la_fortuna: we stayed at hotel monte real, right in town. we wanted to stay central to town because neither of us drive. this worked out well as we were picked up for most excursions and able to walk to meals in town, but the rooms on the property sit off of the road so it still felt secluded. la_fortuna is small, and wasn‚Äôt particularly busy during our stay. we ate at tierra mia, don rufino, soda hormiga, soda viquez, and la fonda 506 (i recommend tierra m√≠a and the sodas). though things close around 9, you can find nightlife if you are seeking it out. there are lots of people at hostels looking to extend the night. we found that uber (which is illegal) was not reliably close by or available, but our hotel was able to call cabs in those cases. taxis are much cheaper in la_fortuna than in mv or manuel antonio since uber is there to drive the prices down. 

across 5 days, our activities included a tour at bogarin wildlife trail, night walk organized via the hotel, arenal hike/hanging bridges/la_fortuna waterfall booked through viator, day at the spa/hot springs at tabacon, don juan coffee and chocolate tour (good for a rainy day, the whole tour is covered), and ziplining at arenal mundo aventura park (amazing views going over the waterfall, and also one of the only places that hires female guides for ‚Äúadventure‚Äù tourism, according to one of our guides there). all were great. 

most people we met were in la_fortuna around 3 days, and you could easily pack a lot of activities into 2-3 days on your itinerary if you are trying to visit more areas or have a shorter overall trip.

monteverde: we traveled via jeep-boat-jeep, which afforded great views of the volcano, and did a quick 2 days here during which we fit in selvatura adventure park and monteverde reserve. i heard great things about the el tigre hike. we stayed at belmar (gorgeous) and did san lucas treetop dining (gimmicky and overpriced, nice views). as others often write, the activities in mv are really similar to la_fortuna. i wouldn‚Äôt skip monteverde because it‚Äôs beautiful, but would allocate some activities we did in la_fortuna for monteverde. 

manuel antonio: we stayed at parador, typical resort vibes. a monkey visited our balcony!! in general manuel antonio had way more tourists than the other 2 spots. we did a beach day, a guided tour day at the national park, and a catamaran cruise day. we enjoyed agua azul and i had great snapper at ronny‚Äôs place, though my friend didn‚Äôt like her food there. manuel antonio had the most predictable weather, sun all day and rain at night. we thought we wouldn‚Äôt want a guide at the national park having had many guided tours through the trip, but it ended up being well worth it ‚Äî i guess we weren‚Äôt the seasoned naturalists we thought we were. 

side notes:
tipping ‚Äî 10 percent is usually included at restaurants. i added on another 10 percent in cash but it‚Äôs probably not really called for.

weather‚Äî umbrella and light jacket from uniqlo did the trick. don‚Äôt rely on the weather app. 

booking ‚Äî we booked most shuttles (interbus) and tours/excursions a day or so in advance. manuel antonio national park should be booked via sinac site a few days in advance if your entrance isn‚Äôt included or you‚Äôre visiting sans tour. 

covid testing - 3 min shuttle from sjo. in and out in 10 mins, with results back via email 10 mins later. 

covid protocols ‚Äî all staff are masked and basically all establishments have sanitizer and sinks installed at the entrance. 

c√≥lones/dollars ‚Äî most places/people take both, and you can use a debit or credit card. 

itinerary ‚Äî for a trip of this length, you could likely fit in another area if you don‚Äôt mind a few more hours of travel/a quicker pace of activities. disclaimer that i know nothing about rentals/driving around. 

let me know if you have any questions!",1,715

Some insights into traveling to Costa Rica from the US right now (Oct. 2020),"1. get to the airport a solid 3 hours before you board (not take off). airlines are taking extra time to make sure you have all the relevant documents, but not telling people to get to the airport even sooner than usual. mobile kiosks and online check-in won't work.

2. if traveling with family, make sure every single traveler (children included) has filled out a health pass. the us embassy site still says you can fill out one per household. this not true.


3. make sure your cell phone has international mobile service. because we believed the us embassy site, we had to get health passes for the kids at the airport. we would have been screwed without it.
      
side note: most everyone was understanding at customs in liberia, but if they don't get their shit together and make sure the correct information is out there, next month will be a clusterfuck for everyone.

have fun! there are no crowds at all. could be that high season doesn't start until next month, but we have yet to encounter another tourist. the weather is fantastic and the water is a solid 78 degrees.",1,192
Example of an Approved International Travel Insurance,"i purchased the [safe travels outbound](https://www.trawickinternational.com/products/safe-travels-outbound) insurance through trawick international for $15. i will explain further down my own understanding of how this insurance covers the lodging expenses requirement. when you are filling out the health pass 48 hours before your trip, there is a spot to upload your travel insurance. i uploaded the visa letter pdf which shows the basic limits of the insurance as well as, in red, that covid is specifically covered in the policy. however, you can only upload one document, and the certificate (14 pages of coverage details) is the document that really goes into what is covered in regards to what part covers lodging. 

after i completed the health pass and received my qr, i received an email from them asking me to forward the certificate and any other documents that i had, specifically they wanted my email to include details on ""trip interruption."" i emailed my documents and within two hours, they replied saying that my insurance was approved.   


as far as on your own, figuring out if insurance covers lodging if you choose a plan other than the one i listed above, it really depends on reading the definitions part of the certificate. in my policy, trip interruption, includes the following statements:   


> the company will reimburse you, up to the maximum benefit shown on the confirmation of coverage, if you join your trip after departure or are unable to continue on the covered trip due to any of the following reasons that are unforeseen and take place after departure:   
>  
>  
>  
> \-your sickness, accidental injury or death, that results in medically imposed restrictions as certified by a physician at the time of loss preventing your continued participation in the trip. a physician must advise to cancel the trip on or before the scheduled return date;   
>  
>\-sickness, accidental injury or death of a family member or traveling companion; booked to travel with you that results in medically imposed restrictions as certified by a physician preventing that person‚Äôs continued participation in the trip;   
>

A little something about bars on all the windows...,"i've seen people comment from time to time about all the bars on the doors and windows and, in some areas, concertina wire.  and i've finally been able to get my thoughts together about this.

in costa_rica, the biggest crime problem is petty theft.  in fact, it's almost like a game or sport!  ""you left those shoes out on your porch so you obviously meant for me to have them!"" 

before moving here, i, too had the attitude ""ugh, i'd never want to live like that.""  and i have lived in a house without any bars and a house with bars.  

in one community where i lived, it was pretty safe and my house had no bars on the windows  or doors or porch.  then... some local young people got into drugs and started ripping off people and places for the money.  they first targeted any ""gringos"" (like me) and a few people who were in town working as volunteers.  laptops got stolen off the kitchen table.  cell phones.  one time, they were so brazen, they walked into a house through the open door and stole a tv while the woman was out back hanging out her laundry.  so i lay there in the dark, no bars on my large windows, and wondering if i would be next.

after a few more houses, i now live in a really cute little house that has no bars on the windows - but - tall concrete fence in the back and a huge front porch and carport that has bars all the way around.  it's great!  i can leave stuff on my front porch and don''t have to worry about some idiot walking by and picking up my weedeater and carrying it off.  it also helps when the many vendors come around selling vegetables, fruits and whatever and also with politicians (this is election time).  i can just stand in my doorway and waggle my finger back and forth and they go away.  and yes, it works for jehovah's witnesses, too!  

so don't be so quick to assume that costa_rica is a dangerous place just because you see a lot of places with bars on the windows.  in some upscale areas, such as escazu, it could be worth the time and effort and violence of a home invasion because of the possibility of large amounts of cash or jewelry or expensive tech - but - not the case in most places.

edit:  just realized i should have added:  most houses in costa_rica do not have air conditioning so it's usual to leave one or more doors open during the day.  having bars on the porch or the door keeps some person or dog from just walking into your house.",1,460
Sodas,"i‚Äôve read lots of advice about eating at sodas instead of sit down places, what kinds of foods are generally served at them? specifically, do they generally have a vegetarian option or is it just one or two items? if it matters we‚Äôre doing la_fortuna and driving to manuel antonio.",1,51

Five days solo in Costa Rica,"hi all,

i'm travelling alone to costa_rica on may 10th-15th (my first solo trip ever!). that was a pretty spontaneous decision, without any specific plans for what to do.

since i'll arrive pretty late (\~8pm), i'll probably stay in san_jose for the first night. then, i'm thinking about staying in la_fortuna for two nights and in monteverde for another two. alternatively, i'm considering la_fortuna + jaco.

what do you suggest to visit - monteverde or jaco? maybe some other place? how is it transportation from la_fortuna to monteverde or jaco? (i can't rent a car unfortunately)

also, do you have any recommendations for local trips and budget accommodations (i'm mostly interested in private rooms)?

thanks a lot!",1,122

I can't stop thinking about a some restaurants,"i was in cr for a month back in early 2014, there were a few restaurants that i ate at while i was there, and there are some that stick out in my mind and i can't stop thinking about them lately and their food. i had to use google maps to check the names of them (as i remember where they were in the locations, just not the name). they are in order of the timeframe as to when i ate at them

the first one that i ate at was rostipollos (near the airport in san_jose), i landed in cr mid afternoon, spent the first night at the hotel by there and ate at rostipollos for supper. 

the second memorable one i ate at is in manuel antonio, (i spent my first 2 weeks in the area), is cafe milagro. i ate there a few times. always had the fish tacos. still the best i've ever had. and their espresso shake is awesome.

the third, is in la_fortuna (spent the next week there). is is the lava lounge. great sea bass wrap. 

the fourth, back in alajuela. was tacotento (near the wal-mart, which i decided to walk around the one day, and first time i'd ever seen alcohol sold in wal-mart. our canadian wal-marts don't sell alcohol)

i will give a couple honourable mentions though. all in manuel antonio. first one is barba roja. food was good, but it is a great place to sit and watch the sunset. it was the first time i'd ever heard people clap at the sunset. second, is called 'z', i don't remember where in ma it was (i think it was on a hotel property), but i remember it was there. and lastly the other mention, is the restaurant/bar at la mariposa hotel. another great place to watch the sunset, but their drinks are amazingly good.

can't wait to go back to cr and eat at some of those places again

edit: i should also point out, there was other places i ate at, but these are ones i fondly remember",1,352
Positive experience with Vamos rental car company,"hi guys, just got back from a great vacation in costa_rica with my wife & son.  based on advice from this subreddit, i decided to go with vamos for renting a car.

first off, just generally, we had a good experience from the beginning. they were waiting for us at the airport, and shuttled us over to the office, which is only a couple of minutes away.  they were friendly and professional, everything was as expected and went smoothly.  a key thing, that turned out later to be a wise decision for us, was to pay for the full insurance up front.

so, we left sjo and drove up to la_fortuna the day of arrival.  the next morning, we were heading out to breakfast, and unfortunately, i got into a collision.  it was my fault, i got distracted or something, not sure exactly, but i turned left in front of an oncoming taxi without enough space between us, so the taxi hit us in the right front of my vehicle.

fyi, the way things work in costa_rica (as explained beforehand by vamos) is:

* you don't move your vehicle from the roadway initially
* you call 911 - this will send out a traffic police crew, who will make a police report.  when they say it's ok, you can then move the car off the road.
* you call the insurance company - they will send out an insurance representative who will do their own report
* you call vamos

i also took some pictures with my phone and sent them to vamos via email.

so, at first i thought the car might be driveable... it had some dents in the front quarter panel and front passenger door, but the headlights weren't damaged.  but when i tried driving it back to where were staying, i found out that the steering was quite affected. i could drive it slowly and fight it a bit to go in a straight line, but it wasn't safe beyond limping slowly about 1 km back to our place.

so then i called vamos again and explained that i would need a replacement vehicle.  since the one i had wasn't driveable, they needed to put the replacement vehicle on a flatbed tow truck in san_jose, drive that up to me, swap it for the damaged vehicle, and drive that one back on the truck.  as you know it's a 3+ hour trip from san_jose to la_fortuna, but they got right on the ball and brought it to me that same evening.  i gave the tow truck driver the paper police report and my copy of the insurance report.

the rest of the trip went smooth, and of course i was extra extra careful with the 2nd vehicle.  honestly i was paranoid, i couldn't imagine having to call them up and tell them something happened to the 2nd one!

so, at the end of the trip, upon returning the vehicle to vamos, everything when smooth and easy again.  no hassles, no extra paperwork, no attitude, still super friendly.

so... big points to vamos for being a great company to rent from.  and, i recommend getting the full insurance if you can manage it -- really it took a lot of stress off me by not having to deal with any of that.",1,561
"Trip Report: 2 weeks in Uvita, La Fortuna, & Monteverde in February","this sub helped us plan our first trip to costa_rica and we had such a great time. i saved several posts where people reported on their trip and found those really helpful, so hoping to do the same now that we‚Äôre back from an amazing trip. pura vida!

&#x200b;

**itinerary**

day 1: fly to san_jose. we landed at 4pm and didn‚Äôt want to drive at night, so we stayed in downtown san_jose for a night.

day 2: adobe delivered our rental car to our hotel and we drove to uvita. stayed at an amazing place called the sutton, right in the jungle. we saw wildlife right outside our room. it‚Äôs more like an airbnb with a shared outdoor kitchen, so we went into town to buy groceries and cooked breakfasts and dinners.

day 3: visited marino ballena national park and walked to the whale‚Äôs tail at low tide. it was hot so make sure to bring tons of water. had lunch at don roger where we had a view of the whale‚Äôs tail from higher up. did a coffee tour at don emilio in the afternoon.

day 4: day trip to corcovado to do a wildlife tour. we saw snakes, spider monkeys, a mama sloth and her baby, scarlet macaws, coatis, bats, falcons, and coolest of all - a crocodile hunting a pelican in the ocean and eating it. this was one of the few things we booked in advance of arriving in costa_rica. we paid for a transfer from uvita to sierpe where the tour begins / ends.

day 5: visited the alturas wildlife sanctuary where we saw an ocelot among many other animals the facility cares for. we also checked into our next hotel in uvita - oxygen jungle villas. we wanted to splurge for a few nights and this place was pricey but worth every dollar. the view was incredible and the staff were wonderful.

day 6: this was the only day we took it easy since we wanted to enjoy the hotel as much as possible. we hiked to 2 waterfalls on the property in the morning and lounged by the pool and got massages in the afternoon. we went to seba‚Äôs for dinner which was incredible - he used to run a restaurant in toronto (where we‚Äôre from) before moving to cr and starting the first farm to table restaurant in uvita. food was amazing, the vibe was really cool, and seba himself came out to chat with us when we arrived. if you go, make a reservation as they‚Äôve been sold out every night since opening 2 months ago.

day 7: drove from uvita to la_fortuna. stopped in tarcoles for lunch and saw the crocodile bridge. got to our hotel, la finca lodge, which was 40 mins outside la_fortuna. we wished we were a little closer to town, but it was great value and the staff were all very friendly and helped us plan and book our activities.

day 8: went ziplining with arenal mundo aventura in the morning. sadly it was cloudy so we didn‚Äôt see the volcano while ziplining, but we did zipline over the la_fortuna waterfall. ate lunch at soda viquez in town and then did mistico hanging bridges in the afternoon. out of everything we did on this trip, the hanging bridges were the only thing we wish we skipped. it was very touristy and just kinda meh in our opinion.

day 9: we were originally going to visit rio celeste but our hotel told us about the waterfalls and blue pools at bajos del toro instead. they are similar to rio celeste in that you can see and swim in turquoise pools, but it is mostly a spot locals visit so it‚Äôs less busy than rio celeste if you go on a weekday. it was 90 mins away from our hotel and there are 3 options: you can visit catarata del toro, you can visit the blue falls, or do both at a discounted price. we chose to do both and it was well worth it. there‚Äôs a bit of hiking required so we wore our hiking boots and changed into sandals and swimsuits at pozo azul (the blue pool).

day 10: we did a guided tour at the bogarin sloth trail in the morning, had lunch at soda la hormiga, and spent the afternoon and evening doing the hot springs and getting massages at the springs resort & spa. we were originally planning to go to tabacon, but another post on this sub mentioned needing to book in advance, and by the time we saw that post we were a month out from our trip and tabacon was fully booked. we bought day passes in advance to the springs instead. i don‚Äôt know how it compares to tabacon, but it was awesome. i kind of wish we had skipped the earlier activities and spent the whole day here instead.

day 11: drove from la_fortuna to monteverde. we stayed at hotel tropico based on another redditor‚Äôs reco that this place has the best sunset views and it did not disappoint. we did a night walk which ended up being our favourite wildlife tour of the whole trip. we saw an owl, a viper, a tarantula, a scorpion, sleeping monkeys, birds, sloths, frogs, and tons of insects.

day 12: this was our only full day in monteverde, but by this point of the trip we felt like we had done almost everything we wanted to do. we did a hike through the santa elena cloud forest reserve. it‚Äôs the least visited of the 3 cloud forests in monteverde. our hotel tried to talk us out of going here, saying it would be cold and wet, and tried to convince us to do a guided tour at the monteverde cloud forest reserve instead. but we just wanted to hike and by this point we didn‚Äôt want to do any more guided tours and felt like we had seen a lot of wildlife already. it was indeed wet and a bit cold, but we had rain jackets and really enjoyed the hike we did at santa elena. there were barely any people there and we felt like we had the forest to ourselves, and we saw some cool birds and bugs. in the afternoon we did a coffee, chocolate, and sugar cane tour at don juan which was really great. we did the treetop dining experience at san lucas for dinner, which we booked in advance of the trip. overall it was a really unique experience and we ended up seeing a sloth in the trees, and it was the closest we got to a sloth the entire trip. the food was good and if the whole thing had cost \~25% less i would be recommending it without hesitation. i still think it‚Äôs worth it if you can afford it, but it felt a bit overpriced to us.

day 13: drove from monteverde to san_jose. adobe picked up the rental car at our hotel. our flight the next day was early so we didn‚Äôt want to drive from monteverde on the morning of our flight.

day 14: flew home out of san_jose.

&#x200b;

**driving**

my husband did all the driving. he is a good driver but it was still stressful. roads are narrow and winding often with no guardrails or shoulders and a steep drop off the side. the worst is when you're stuck behind a slower vehicle and it's difficult to pass given all the curves. some areas had really bad potholes and we encountered stray dogs, cats, coatis, a goat, and even an armadillo while driving which makes the driving more stressful.

we had 4wd and i would highly recommend it - some roads in more rural areas or on the way to certain attractions are very steep and unpaved. our first hotel had a super steep driveway and some guests who did not have 4wd had to park at the bottom since their car could not make it up.

i would also recommend limiting nighttime driving to only what is necessary. we drove at night a few times, like when we had dinner in town and drove back to the hotel after dark. the roads do not use reflective paint like we are used to in canada and unless you are in town, there are no street lights so it is extremely dark.

&#x200b;

**random tips**

* costa_rican mandarins are great for rubbing on bug bites. our first hotel had a few trees on the property and let us take several mandarins with us. way more effective than the anti-itch bug bite cream we had packed.
* tap water is safe to drink.
* gas stations are all full service.
* if you are not american and are paying by credit card, it‚Äôs better to be charged in colones vs. usd. most places accept credit cards but a few places were cash only (accepting usd or colones). we had some usd and took out colones once we landed.
* almost all businesses, hotels, tour companies, restaurants, etc. in cr use whatsapp. very convenient for making reservations or asking questions.
* i often had lte or 3g but zero bars for most of the trip, even in downtown san_jose. this is probably why most businesses are on whatsapp since the internet seems more reliable than cell service. there were still areas where there was no internet. we downloaded all of costa_rica in google maps for offline use and it definitely came in handy.",1,1606
Costa Rica appreciation post,"no questions or requests for info. i just wanted to take a moment to say how much i love this country and its people.

when my wife and i first started coming here about 10 years ago, we mostly stuck to popular destinations where it wouldn‚Äôt be too challenging to be a foreigner. over time, we‚Äôve branched out and visited some of the more local communities and found everyone to be lovely and friendly. our spanish-speaking has gotten better over time, but still very much a work-in-progress. even so, local spots (say a random soda in a small town), the people are so friendly - they work with us on our espa√±ol, offering advice (corrections lol), and genuinely seem to appreciate our efforts to speak the language and get to know more about the culture of this wonderful country. we‚Äôve been many places around the world but this place is uniquely special. 

that is all - just want to say that i think this is among the most beautiful places on earth, and so are its people ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,178

Visiting Nauyaca Waterfalls by bus from Manuel Antonio / Quepos / Uvita - save $100!,"tours from ma cost $130 to visit the falls for the day though it's totally possible to visit by bus for a fraction of that. i went crazy trying to find info about this online and had to figure a lot of it out for myself, sharing the info for anyone else going in the future.

so, here is a rare helpful guide if you're travelling from uvita: https://www.beanexploring.com/how-to-get-to-nauyaca-waterfalls-without-a-car/

and the below is if you're travelling from ma / quepos:

a bus leaves quepos bus terminal at 5am heading to san isidro, but it goes right past the waterfalls ticket office, so if you ask the driver when you get on they will agree to stop there. our bus showed up about 5:10 and dropped us off around 6:50, costing about $3. 

(we came from ma so just got a 5 minute taxi to the quepos bus station first, which cost $4.50.)

once arriving, we then waited 10 mins for the ticket office to open (7am) and paid $10 each for a hiking ticket. it took us about 1hr 15 to reach the waterfalls and we were the first ones there with the sun rising over the top which was incredible. we were so thankful we got up early!

to get back, you need to catch either the 12:20 or 16:20 bus heading back to quepos from outside the main ticket office. the hike is a lot harder coming back, particularly a horrendous uphill stretch at the end, so you should plan at least 2 hours to make the hike back.

we spent 1hr 30 at the waterfalls then made the 12:20 bus back, which felt like a perfect amount of time.

once back in quepos, we spent $0.50 to get the regular bus back to ma.

in total, the costs would be the below for 1 person:
- taxi to quepos bus station: $4.50
- bus there and back to the waterfalls ticket office: $6
- hiking ticket: $10
- packed lunch: $5

so you're looking at $25.50 rather than $130. hope that's useful to someone who was in my shoes!",1,352

san_jose- holiday inn great///
la_fortuna- hotel secrero la_fortuna, soda viquez, los lagos hot springs day pass, mistico w/ guide///
monteverde- el tigre waterfalls, monteverde. cloud forest, la cocina do√±a mayra, cafe orchid (smoothies)///

things we learned/do differently/tips:

-thanks to this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/s6y0no/if_you_need_a_driver_in_costa_rica_between_sjo_to/) we also used carlos and he was fantastic. cost $120 from sjo-> la_fortuna, gave us great local tips as he‚Äôs from la_fortuna, showed us his uncle‚Äôs hot springs and was an all around wonderful find. he also has contacts in other towns to help you schedule rides. highly recommend to contact him regardless where you are! the cost is comparable to a shuttle sometimes but much more convenient and personalized. thanks u/rebeccalmighty

-there are no chocolate plantations in monteverde but they do have them in la_fortuna so do them there!

-we knew it was rainy season and were prepared to do activities wet and possibly not see as many animals. we were excited to see the natural beauty of the land, meet the people and learn the culture so not seeing animals was not as big of a deal. 

-recommend a good rain jacket and/or large reusable poncho to cover any bags. garbage bags to pack your clothes inside your suitcase is also a cheap option. quick dry clothing is a must as it is humid and wet. also quick dry shoes (like sandals) or water shoes are excellent choices

-plan all your big activities in the morning and keep afternoons flexible bc it usually rains

-transportation is more expensive than we thought. food is cheaper in the sodas but more expensive in monteverde overall with less options. 


day 1 san_jose: traveled all day and arrived late into san_jose, got a free shuttle to stay at the holiday inn by the airport which was very convenient (and free by using points). rooms were a good size, clean, quiet, bed was really comfy but the breakfast was excellent. lots of fresh fruit cut to order, delicious eggs and meat with lots of yogurt and juice. surprised and impressed. 

day 2-4 la_fortuna: got picked up by carlos in his 4x4 and drove to la_fortuna. he showed us some sights and was very flexible along the way so you can make it what you want. 

-hotel secreto la_fortuna: excellent value for the money (~$50 per night). air conditioning, king size bed, hot water, free delicious breakfast, good wifi and safes in each room. also they have a pool and there is lush green fauna everywhere you walk outside your room. perfect view of the volcano. centrally located but off the main strip so it‚Äôs quiet. we even saw a sloth on our last day!

-arenal 1968: hiking trail at one of the national forests. it cost $19pp, you can pay more for a guide but we didn‚Äôt feel the need to. there are two trails, 4 and 6 km i believe. we got there late and only had time for the shorter one bc they closed at 5 pm. fun hike, we got rained on with lots of thunder as well which felt unreal when out from under the trees. there is a small cafe at the end with beautiful 360 degree views. wish we had time to go back and do the longer one. 

-mistico hanging gardens w/ guide: felt the extra money for the guide was worth it and not too expensive. we didn‚Äôt see many animals which was fine. it was also raining quite a bit but the hanging bridges were really magical. we were in a large group (6 uni grads and a family with a 4ish year old) but it was still enjoyable. they require closed toed shoes fyi. 

-los lagos hot springs: one of the highlights!! let me start of by saying i spent hours (hours) trying to figure out which hot spring to go to. there are so many to choose from of different sizes and budgets it can get overwhelming. if you are a typical person without an extravagant budget but still want lots of variety, quality and a peaceful time where locals even go, come here. it was $17pp with a swim up wet bar, around 10 hot springs of varying temps, a few secluded spots for privacy/romance and a couple of regular pools with an awesome slide! baldi and tabacon are the more expensive ones for $60-80 respectively but i seriously doubt they are 3-4x better. plus carlos confirmed my choice when we asked him so what more do you want!?

-food: please make sure you go to soda viquez as they are warm, friendly, have delicious food and amazingly priced meals. make sure to try their casado pescado, it was so good. soda hormiga and la familia are worth a visit as well. i would skip fonda and balcon arenal though the latter has great views of arenal even if they are both overpriced imo. 

day 4-6 monteverde: took a jeep-boat-jeep through casa batsu which was great. roads after the boat were poor >50% of the way and very windy. 

chamber of tourism: awesome place that can give you all the info on tours and transportation. they can book the tours for you too at no extra cost. highly recommend starting here if you haven't booked everything and want more info. 

cabinas el pueblp b&b/hostel: hospitality is 5/5, in town, free breakfast, private bathroom, unlimited coffee they grow on their own farm. hosts were so helpful but room is missing some basics like a washcloth, no fans when it is hot and can't sleep with the windows open as anyone can come into the room. if you're ok with basics with amazing hospitality check it out. 

pueblo coffee tour: $40pp incl transport, family run and very personalized. only 4 in our group and our guide junior was incredibly knowledgeable. initially thought of doing don juan but kept hearing how commercialized it was though can't confirm

zip lining (aka canopy tour): went with 100% aventura and i was skeptical at first but it was a great experience, especially the tarzan swing. they have the longest zip line in cr at 1.5 km!! 

monteverde cloud forest: $25pp, can take the public bus for $2pp. lots of good hiking and variety of trails to pick. good views if there aren't clouds and even a waterfall and suspension bridge. simply beautiful. 

el tigre waterfalls: arguably the highlight of our monteverde trip. somewhat pricey at $41pp w/transportation but it is quite an experience with lots of waterfalls and a great challenging hike. would rate it difficult of you don't use the horses/jeep at the last steep portion but if you do then moderate. they have a restaurant there and a whole package that's more expensive if interested. don't miss this experience if you can go. 

food: we felt taco taco was overrated and over priced. we fell in love with la cocina do√±a mayra for their excellent casados (the chicken was amazing), amazing prices (3000c!) and family vibe where the locals go. soda la salvadita was decent too. also recommend cafe orchid, we only got their smoothies but food looks decent though pricey. bar amigos had a good vibe before 7 pm but we left before the whippersnappers got there to party the night away. 

days 7-8 playa del coco: coming right up!",1,1305
Positive Test and quarantine AMA,"edit: tldr - wedding in cr. tested positive, isolation order for 7 days-


as the title states, i just received a positive test. figured i‚Äôd start a thread to help anyone who is curious about the process or is going through the same situation *if this type of threads are posted a lot and it‚Äôs an annoyance i can easily delete*

the story:
  planned our wedding at an all inclusive resort. everyone invites to the wedding tested negative prior to arriving in the country per our recommendation. 1) to help keep everyone safe and healthy 2) ironically to help prevent this situation. 

our plan was 1 week on resort in guanacaste then a week in monteverde split between two spots. 

arrived wednesday afternoon with about half the guests in the wedding. other half came a week early through another package. 

welcome party and wedding went flawlessly. literally everything went perfect. that never happens. 
so as it goes. the day after the wedding i started feeling stuffy. figured allergies. took some allegra and moved on with the weekend. woke up monday with a cough and more congestion. took an emed test. ( we brought a 6 pack to cover basis if we felt off. the plan was to be here for two weeks).  test came in positive. isolated in our room. and got in touch with everyone to get tested. everyone in the wedding party has tested negative so far. half the party flew home sunday before my and are all clear. 

wife‚Äôs lab test was negative, however she was feeling off so took another home test it came up positive so we spoke to the hotel about my positive lab test and her positive home test. they are scheduling a pcr for the room and going to work with putting us up and making sure the process for us goes as smooth as possible. 

they did recommend the wife leave now while she has a negative lab test but she doesn‚Äôt want to get on a plan knowing she has symptoms, so awaiting the pcr. 

the resort is giving us a discounted room
rate with keeping the all inclusive amenities. we have a direct contact to work with and they are going to be in contact with the ministry of health to help assist with everything. so far they have been accommodating. 

the first hotel in monteverde were kind enough to refund 50% for us and the remaining 50% goes to a new reservation. (just a good excuse to come back to this beautiful country) 

i will keep the thread alive with updates throughout and i‚Äôll have nothing to do so i can answer questions all day

My Top 5 beaches in Guanacaste,"premise; i'm an old fart and i don't surf, windsurf, kitesurf (you get the picture). i like bobbing about in the ocean, occasionally doing a few breaststrokes, reading on the beach while sipping a cold imperial.
so my top beaches probably cater to other oldies like me or families with young children. 
so here's my tuppence worth (that's 2 cents to you americanos, canadiens and aussies).

playa nacascolo.
playa penca.
playa conchal.
playa mina.
playa carrillo.

you will find plenty of information and images of these beaches on google and other sites.

The Costa Rican craft beer scene is AMAZING!,"there are so many options when it comes to planning your vacation. where will you stay, what will you do? where will you eat? etc etc. but is craft beer on your radar? it should be!

For anyone looking for rides for a reasonable price and good talks,"hey guys, im currently in jaco, cr. and want to thank carlos u/arenalrides.

at first he took us from the airport to la_fortuna, clearing out all our doubts about the country, tours, hotels, foods (we are vegan), etc. he also gave us a tour in his family house for us to learn a bit about cocoa, vainilla and other local products his family produce.

then he gave us a ride super early to rio celeste, so we could enter the park at 8:00. we had an amazing tour at the park, with very little amount of people inside of it (kids screaming and such :/).

finally he took us to jaco from la_fortuna and we countinue speaking about our next steps in the country and answering our questions.

i really hope you can contact him and get a nice time in costa_rica

Trip Review: 1 week from US,"sitting at sjo waiting on a delayed flight so going to post what i can while it's fresh! hoping to make this pretty detailed so i'll likely separate it into parts in the comments. 

**departing us/arriving sjo** 

* checked bags have to be on the plane an hour before your departing time, at least on sw. we got to the airport 3.5 hours before our departure and made it to the checked bag counter with 16 minutes to spare. so yes, we were in the line for nearly 2 hours. idk if that was a random bwi occurrence or the norm but be prepared! the line in large part was so long and slow bc people were not prepared for this & then stood at the counter complaining for an excessive amount of time... 

* the flight attendants told us we'd need masks in sjo but even not all the employees were wearing them. we did and weren't the only ones but it's not being enforced. 

* going through immigration here they only took 1 address from us even though we were staying in 3 places. we haven't traveled internationally since pre-covid & thought they might be stricter about this now but nope. our person also didn't check for our return flights, just asked how long we were staying. 

* after getting our bag we went outside to find the vamos shuttle. they were pretty much all the way at the end to the right but easy to find. waited maybe 15-20 minutes for the shuttle. 

* no issues with vamos. we gave them our copy of the letter from chase for insurance and they copied our passports and driver's licenses even though i'd emailed them photos. we did a walk around the car and they noted any dents and scratches while we recorded. nothing additional noted when we returned the car today so hopefully no surprises show up in the next 30 days.

* we got a phone and a cooler included. the phone came with a car holder, car charging port, wall charger, and mini usb cable (was an old samsung). we used it for waze, whatsapp, google, and local calls and texts. also used it as a hotspot.",1,371
"9 day trip recap - tips + recommendations, SJO, La Fortuna, Guanacaste Papagayo","went on my first trip to costa_rica this august and wanted to share some advice and recommendations i learned along the way since i used this /r so much for planning.  


**me:** 30 year old solo female from usa; fluent in english + spanish; frequent traveler; loves a good deal and modest accommodations; loves walking

**apps used:**   
google maps (w/ saved offline areas), currency converter, uber, whatsapp  
survived off free wifi

**locations visited:**  
sjo airport > alajuela > la_fortuna > guanacaste papagayo > liberia airport

**transportation from the sjo airport:**  
i grabbed an uber. wifi worked in the restaurant right outside of the airport so i called them from there to establish meeting place at airport parking lot. (uber is technically illegal in costa_rica so they try to avoid taxi areas and you have to ride upfront) took it to my hotel in alajuela, cost about $5. uber driver lived in alajuela and gave some good recommendations for food & bank directions for atms.

**transportation from alajuela to la_fortuna, la_fortuna to guanacaste:**  
used [interbus](https://www.interbusonline.com/home) (scheduled the day before) both times - wifi available on bus and a stop mid-ride for bathroom/coffee break.  
i looked at many different shuttles, but they were the only ones providing a single traveler option in a shared shuttle for the dates/times i wanted.   
in alajuela, pick up was at denny's near sjo airport (wifi available) and dropped off directly at my airbnb. only one other traveler so took about 3.5hrs  
in la_fortuna, they picked up directly from my airbnb to my hotel. transferred with other shuttles, both were full. 

  
**lodging specifics:**

alajuela lodging:  
stayed in [alajuela city hotel](https://www.alajuelacityhotel.com/) \- wifi was spotty in room (okay for browsing, not so great for media streaming/calls), but worked wonderfully in the seated outdoor area. staying in the city, you can hear road traffic noises, but it wasn't too loud at night. the main door is kept locked 24/7 with someone at reception and individual key for my door, felt very safe! heather (the owner) + ricardo took care of my early morning taxi and had coffee ready for me :d

la_fortuna:  
stayed at [bogarin trail](https://lafortunasancarlos.com/) cabins (booked on airbnb the week of). everything is within walking distance (groceries, restaurants) and you're literally in the middle of the park. its awesome, highly recommend.  


things i did in la_fortuna/recommendations:

rainforest chocolate tour - i liked the tour guide, but the place was specifically made to give tours so wasn't ""off the beaten path"". 

el salto, rio fortuna - i walked there from my airbnb, a little over a mile from the city center, but road has a sidewalk that feels safe. it's free and beautiful! i spent a good quiet hour just sitting by the river. theres a little trail you can follow so you dont have to stay right by the entrance trail area that can get kinda crowded.  

mistico arenal hanging bridge park + arenal natura ecological park: again i was traveling solo and didnt have transportation. there are so many tour guide people in la_fortuna, you will not have issue finding someone to give a guided tour-- i booked mine two days before. for me it worked out fine, but doing research i've seen post that the person/company i used stole credit card info before? i guess fortunately i paid in cash and was fine. for mistico- i could have done it alone. it was easy, paved, and heavily traveled. for the hike i did at the volcano, i was very glad i had a guide! it was a little lonely and not highly marked.

for food: i mostly just walked around looking at things till i found something i wanted to eat. highly recommend el chante verde, i walked there after going to el salto, a little out of the way but definitely worth it.  


in **guanacaste** i was staying at an all-inclusive resort with work, very fancy, very not my style, very stay on the resort type vibe. only recommendation/advice i have is **tio leo's coffee tour**! it was amazing! it was about three hours, we made empanadas, had platanos, had some rum, had a chocolate scrub, oh yeah and tried some coffee. seriously can not recommend this place enough. tio leo even signed the coffee bags i bought!

&#x200b;

hope this helps some, happy to try to answer any questions!",1,735
Solo backpacker Costa Rica June2021,"hi everyone! 26f doing an 11 day solo backpacking trip in costa_rica. highly active - i love hiking, trail running, and immersing myself in nature. been doing some research on cr and would love some input!

i'm flying into san_jose on a saturday. initially i wanted to check out corcovado, but i think for this quick trip, it's out of my budget. i don't want to spend too much time busing around, so i'm trying to prioritize and limit destinations. i'll be solo and want to meet people and party when not hiking. 

for beach town destinations, what do you think about tamarindo vs santa teresa vs samara? i know tamarindo is the most touristy and developed - normally i would skip something like that and opt for more remote, but given covid travel restrictions, i'm worried smaller towns might be too deserted or like ghost towns. so i'd go to tamarindo if it meant better chance of meeting more people and wouldn't be as crowded as normal - especially since it's off-season june and with covid.

that said, i definitely need to get in quality nature. there's the cabo blanco nature preserve near santa teresa. what do you think about these coastline hikes? should i add a trip to monteverde, manuel antonio, or elsewhere? i really want some dense jungle and put it some high mileage (not just 2 mile hikes). i like the idea of starting somewhere adventurous, hiking a lot, and then maybe finishing my trip at a beach town to party and relax.

thank you :)",1,262
Costa Rica to lengthen nighttime driving restrictions - DOES NOT APPLY TO RENTAL CARS,"i have seen a number of posts about the driving restrictions, many implying that the restriction applies to tourists. if you are driving a rental car it doesn‚Äôt apply to you.  in addition if you‚Äôre driving to a hotel or to/from the airport it also doesn‚Äôt apply no matter what vehicle you‚Äôre in. 

tourism is very important to costa_rica‚Äôs economy and passing on accurate info to those who want to travel is important.

10 days in Costa Rica - review,"hi,

just wanted to share my awesome adventure to costa_rica. met my expectations and perhaps exceeded it. very beautiful country and friendly people.

day 1 - got in liberia airport at 10 pm and stayed at hostal green house in town. was a fine hostel to stay in overnight after flight or could would work well to stay in overnight before flight the next morning. uber there was much cheaper and easier than dealing with the taxi hires who will somewhat pressure you to get them.

days 2-4 stayed in playa del coco. the town itself is nice albeit highly gringo. not super authentic, but it had all the amenities required. i spent most of my time exploring the nearby beaches such as playa hermosa and playa penca. highly recommend playa penca if you can get to it. very pretty and very private. the road in is super treacherous, however i was able to do it in a non 4wd car. just took my time. went ziplining and atving at the congo trail. was a good time, about 100 for the two events.

days 5-7 stayed at a hostel called cora vida in quepos. quepos was more 'authentic' than coco and maybe not quite as tourist developed but was still nice. i went to manuel antonio and the surrounding beaches for two days. while very pretty, i found ma to be a little overrated. perhaps because it was packed with people, the wildlife was not as present as i had hoped. i got a guide because it was 'highly' recommended to see wildlife but i felt like i could have saved the near 40 i paid for the guide. if you dont get a guide, you can kind of piggy back off tours to try and find wildlife, you just wont get to use their special viewing telescope. 

days 8-10 stayed in la_fortuna. did a nighttime wildlife tour. was pretty neat, saw mostly frogs and a few birds. paid 50 for it and felt a little overpriced. if money is not an issue id recommend but if you're on budget i'd probably skip. the next day i did canyoning with desafio and it was probably the highlight of the trip, activity-wise. was very fun and intense but i did not feel scared by it, speaking as someone with a bit of fear of heights. was 100 bucks for an afternoon but i loved it and it came with a buffet at the end.

the next morning i woke up to get to sjo and fly to panama city for a few days, which i recommend. for those interested, check copa airlines. they offer a 'free' layover in panama city if you fly with them from one location to another. similar to what icelandic air does for transatlantic flights. 

i probably spent about 400 000 colones, if you're wondering how much money to take out. rented my car with adobe and had no issue, they were very professional and picked me up from my hostel at the start and drove me to the airport at the end. my routine seemed to be one adventure day followed by a chill relaxing day. i'd recommend everyone to consider a fair amount of 'chilling' time in their itinerary and also overestimate the driving times due to construction, traffic, general costa_rica things. overall the roads were fine. the 713 (on my route from quepos/jaco to la_fortuna) is a pretty intimidating drive. steep roads, many curves and often gravel at times. take it slooooooow. i practiced spanish about 15-30 minutes a day a week before with duolingo. i spoke little spanish where i could but people were very appreciative of the fact. was surprised at how few people bothered to even say ""como estas?"". i was able to get my point understood for the times i was speaking with someone who did not know english. if you have any questions about my trip, feel free to ask.

Moving to Costa Rica (Or Belize),"hello, this is the first time i‚Äôve posted in this group, so hopefully i do this right! 

so i‚Äôm a 34 y/o male that lives on the central coast of california, u.s. i‚Äôve lived here in california my entire life, in 2 cities, and they just raised my rent.

the thing is, i‚Äôm medically retired from a work injury. it‚Äôs for the rest of my life, but from what i‚Äôve read, i‚Äôll still need to get insurance there. from everything i‚Äôve read, i could be living very comfortable in a nice spot.

from everything i‚Äôve read, i could, actually be living a dream. i‚Äôve got no wife, never married, no kids. 

i also don‚Äôt have much travel experience. im also not looking to burn through money just going places, because as long as i‚Äôm here there‚Äôs rent and bills to pay, and this is a fixed income.

how do i make this a reality? i could also sell my relatively new car with 11k miles and probably get and extra $30k, unless i‚Äôd really need one there. 

so how does one go about moving out of the united states and to a place like costa_rica? i can‚Äôt seem to get any solid answers through internet searches.

What's the big deal with Nosara?,"i've been here over the holidays (doing some work), and to say i'm underwhelmed would be an understatement. it's ridiculously overpriced but at the same time there doesn't seem to be much here, just (overpriced) organic smoothie bars along a dirt track and (overpriced) wellness retreats and meditation circles if that's your thing. the infrastructure is crap, wherever the money is going it's not on the roads, and apart from an abundance of howler monkeys i've barely seen any wildlife (previously lived in quepos and saw scarlet macaws and giant iguanas almost every day). it's also - dare i say - pretty pretentious and seems to have lost its authentic tico vibe. the whole place feels like a giant waste of money.

Costa Rica for a dental procedure? Advice from a local,"i know costa_rica is a leader country on heath tourism. i've read some posts asking about prices or telling stories or experiences.

Reflections on my trip to Arenal/La Fortuna/Playa Hermosa,"just got back from my first trip to cr, and it was absolutely epic.  i figured i'd jot down some notes in case anybody in the future searches for particular accommodations/activities this would come up and potentially be helpful.  


spent the first 3 nights staying at tabacon.  we initially were planning on staying somewhere else and just getting a day pass to the hot springs there on one of our days.  but the day passes are expensive so it seemed to make more sense to just spend a few nights.  still expensive, but wow was it luxurious.  i think the only other time i've stayed somewhere that nice was on my honeymoon.  and the hot springs there were amazing.  we had a great stay...albeit expensive.  


we then spent 4 nights at arenal observatory lodge.  less luxurious but had a very cool nature-centric focus.  tons of birding groups were there...picture folks who all looked like retired college professors carrying humongous cameras and binoculars.  the view out of our room was spectacular.  great hiking on the grounds, and the restaurant on site was fantastic.  


we opted to stay by the ocean for our last 4 nights, and it took us a while to decide what kind of accommodations we wanted.  i was leaning towards an airbnb somewhere, while my wife wanted to stay at an all-inclusive.  she ultimately won out, but since we're not made of money and had already splurged at tabacon, we had to look for a more inexpensive all-inclusive.  unfortunately that mean choosing between margaritaville and planet hollywood.  since i absolutely cannot stand jimmy buffet, we went with ph.  


the resort was nice enough, but the service was rough and there were a lot of hiccups with our reservation.  as expected, it definitely felt kind of trashy and cheesy.  on multiple occasions we witnessed belligerent drunk people get escorted away by the staff.  the pool always had a dj blasting pop music at full volume by it.  so we took our days and did what we could get off the grounds and explore some of the quieter beaches in the vicinity.  playa hermosa and playa cabuyal were both gorgeous.  while it was nice to have our food and drinks taken care of, in retrospect we should have stayed at an airbnb.  it wasn't a bad stay, but it was definitely the worst accommodations out of the 3.  


as for our activities, impressions went as follows:  
mistico hanging bridges - they were cool but not mind blowing.  we went on several hikes in places in the arenal/fortuna area that were free or cheaper that were just as nice.  


ziplining - we went with jacamar tours and did the ziplining and tarzan swing.  it was a ton of fun, our guides were great, and it was very personal and fun.  


rafting - we went with costa_rica descents because they offered class ii/iii rafting on the sarapiqui river and allowed my kids to raft too (ages 7 and 9).  doing research ahead of time, we landed on that river because it looked both adventurous and beautiful.  halfway through rafting, the guide told us we were actually on the balsa river, and that the sarapiqui was closed for rafting!  while we still had a good time, that would have been nice to know in advance!  


animal sanctuary - we did a tour and volunteering mission with proyecto asis where we got to prepare food for a bunch of rescued animals.  it was a fun, educational and enriching experience for our whole family.  carlos our guide was excellent!  highly recommend.",1,597

UK to CR travel experience,"i‚Äôve seen others give detailed explanations of their travel and since this subreddit has been so valuable to me i thought i‚Äôd share my experience so that perhaps it can benefit others. 

i flew from london heathrow, connected through madrid and then onto san_jose. i did a pcr test at a private clinic around 66 hours before my first flight and got the results within 24 hours. i also bought the cheaper ins insurance. 

as others have mentioned having all documents printed helps and even if you‚Äôre transiting through madrid you need a separate qr code for the spanish government called fcs although no one checked mine. 

at heathrow check in i had my pcr test and insurance checked. then upon getting to my gate in madrid they checked my pasa de salud qr code, insurance and pcr test. unfortunately i don‚Äôt speak spanish fluently and so there was some confusion with my documents mainly the pcr test and qr code since it had my british airways flight number on it when the flight was run by iberia but operated by ba. this was all sorted with an english speaking attendant but we were delayed about 30 mins and the process was far from smooth but that‚Äôs to be expected. lots of people having their documents being checked multiple times and struggling with the language barrier as only one man was checking 30+ peoples documents and didn‚Äôt speak english. 

after i arrived the line for passport control in san_jose was long but super easy check for me. my qr code was pre-scanned and i was simply asked where i was staying, how long for and why. i didn‚Äôt have to show any documents besides my qr code again and passport and then i was through. others did have more stringent document checks so i‚Äôm not sure if i got lucky! 

hope this helps, i‚Äôll try to answer an questions but thank you for everyone on this subreddit for giving advice. made the process way easier!",1,337

**weather**: like a lot of people, we were slightly apprehensive about whether it was a mistake to do this trip in mid/late august, but the weather proved to be not a problem. perhaps we got lucky, but the rain only impacted our trip in the following ways.

\-hacienda baru in dominical wasn't offering night tours due to heavy rains at night so we did one in san gerardo de rivas instead.

\-one beach day got cut a bit short

\-lots of mud on some of the trails

\-not every day resulted in a sunset

\-the nauyaca waterfall was so full of water that you could barely swim, even in the lower falls. but this was sorta cool - it was perhaps the most intense cold water plunge i've ever done!

so in short, really small details that overall didn't put a damper on the trip. in exchange, everything was so green and lush.

**money**: we didn't do enough research here. i read somewhere it would be easy to figure out at the airport, but this proved wrong - the airport had terrible rates, and the atm there charged a fee - at least, this was true for what was available around the exit. and then in our first two spots (the san gerardos) there were no atms. we had brought some cash, and most people took credit cards, so this wasn't a huge problem, but we would have planned this slightly differently. 

**language**: the further afield you get from the well-trodden tourist trail, the more it helps to know spanish. you can certainly manage without, but the fact that my boyfriend is fluent helped especially with buses, and in san gerardo de rivas (the least touristy place by far). on that note - there are two, (albeit overlapping) tourist economies in costa_rica - one mainly marketed at foreigners, and one mainly marketed at nationals. so if you search online for hotels in spanish, you sometimes will get different results. 

**packing for august**: i wouldn't say you need a waterproof backpack - we did fine with a backpack with a rain cover. i was very glad for our raincoats, waterproof hiking sandals, quick drying socks, quick drying trail runners, and travel umbrellas. i'd say these are all musts if you plan on hiking. 

**on not renting a car**: i was in favor of renting of car, but my boyfriend was very opposed, so we didn't. ultimately, similar to how costa_rica's microclimates mean that you can't make blanket statements about the weather, you really can't make blanket statements about the conditions of the roads. the roads from san_jose down along the pacific to uvita were all fine, and really no different than the us. the roads in the mountains were often another story, plus prone to intense fog, even in the daytime. these were moments where i was glad we weren't driving. i'm sure there are things we could have seen that we didn't see because of not having a car, but our days were packed regardless - there is so much to see in costa_rica, i wouldn't get hung up on seeing specific things. so, ultimately i'm glad we didn't rent a car - it saved us money, and we still saw a lot. the buses in costa_rica are very comfortable and are pretty good at sticking to the schedule, with clearly marked bus stops. we supplemented this with one private ride and one shuttle ride when it made sense to save time.

# san gerardo de dota

we arrived by bus from the musoc terminal. we got there maybe 10min before the bus was set to leave and managed to get two of the last seats. they leave quite frequently though. you take the bus going to perez zeledon - and ask the bus driver to let you off at 80km. there is a bathroom/snack break about 1.5hrs into the bus ride - after that stop, it's about 20min left. we were not the only tourists on the bus, and it seemed like the bus driver was used to tourists wanting to be let off at different points along the way. the 80km stop (at the top of the road going to san gerardo de dota) is an official bus stop.

we were exhausted from our early-morning flight, and i was very glad we weren't driving these roads half-awake - lots of winding, narrow roads with blind curves, and occasionally quite foggy. 

if arriving by bus, you can arrange for your hotel to pick you at the bus stop. depending on how far down the valley your hotel is, it will be anywhere from $10-$20. we stayed at sue√±o del bosque lodge for roughly $65 per night (includeding breakfast), which was a great value. it was located almost at the bottom of the valley, had a good amount of trails on the grounds, including a hanging canopy bridge, and a waterfall trail. while their marketing is almost all in spanish, the front-end staff all speak english. it is located near the longer waterfall trail at the end of the valley, and it's next door to savegre, which has the most extensive trail system in the valley. 

another nice thing about san gerardo de dota is that five families own all of the land and businesses, so you are pretty much guaranteed to be supporting costa_ricans with your tourist $ - as well as conservation of this magical cloud forest. 

our only formal tour was a 6hr-ish hike down from cerro de la muerte, which takes you from tundra at around 11k ft back to the savegre hotel at around 8k ft. we booked this with savegre, and it was easily our favorite tour. our guide julian was extremely knowledgable about birds, plants, and fungi, friendly, and good at calling birds! i'd say you really can't go wrong with savegre - the whole family that runs the place is very dedicated to birding/nature. 

we spent two nights here. that was enough time to get a sense of the diverse plant life and birds. but i could imagine spending three nights here if your goal is to relax more - we were pretty much hiking around from 5:30am to sunset.

# san gerardo de rivas

we were driven here by an employee at sue√±o del bosque. he only spoke spanish, so this was a moment where my boyfriend's fluency helped. also another time when i was glad we were not driving - lots of pea soup fog on the roads + a really intensely rough and steep road going up to where he dropped us off, at hotel uran. from there we walked the rest of the way (it's a really rough road) about 15min with our luggage to the entrance of the cloudbridge reserve, where we were staying. 

this was the favorite part of the trip for both of us. the folks at cloudbridge are very warm and welcoming, and are doing good work in terms of conservation, reforestation, and research. our accommodation was a very charming cabin located in a lush cloud forest - one morning we watched monkeys play in a tree from our bed. the cabin was rustic, so don't expect luxury - i'd say it was somewhere between glamping and a hotel, but that was fine for us - indeed, this was our favorite accommodation. cloudbridge has many miles of trails, and very few people. one day we hiked for 6ish hours and didn't see a single person. the other day we only saw people while returning on the chirripo trail. excellent star gazing at night - there is no light pollution. besides too many types of birds to count, including some really striking ones, we saw monkeys and coatis. 

we did a night tour through them. our guide, oscar, was a research scientist who did these tours for fun/extra money. so of course he was quite knowledgeable. we saw a variety of interesting insects, a tree python, a tarantula, and rubber frogs. it was raining for part of it, which he explained would make it harder to see wildlife, but we still had a good time. 

here i was very glad we brought hiking sticks. the trails here are *steep*. a lot of intense inclines up and down stairs or worse, very steep inclines with lots of slippery dead leaves. the sticks provided stability for these (as well as some river crossings), and lessened the impact on the 'ole knees going down. we were still really sore by the time we were done with this part of the trip. we are admittedly not in top shape, but we run/do yoga regularly. 

# dominical/uvita/manuel antonio

we spent four nights in dominical - two at hacienda baru and two at hotel tropical sands dominical eco inn. reason for the split was since we didn't have a car, and since hacienda baru was outside of town, we figured it would be nice to have some nights close to dominical proper. 

hacienda baru was the most expensive place we stayed ($116 per night) but a good value - very lovely rooms, a pool, and access to all of their trails that are full of wildlife, and an almost private beach. plus, the free breakfast was the largest and tastiest we had from a hotel. we were also impressed with each dinner we had at their restaurant. each time we hiked their trails we saw monkeys, coatis, agoutis, so many peccaries, not to mention all of the iguanas hanging out around the rooms. 

hotel tropical sands dominical was the only hotel on this trip i would not recommend. for one thing, the more expensive a/c rooms are much less nice than the cheaper fan rooms. we had booked an a/c room but asked if possible, could we switch to a fan room. we were told that wouldn't be possible, but then the next night when the power went out for the a/c rooms we were told if it didn't get fixed soon, they'd move us to a fan room. so, somewhat dishonest. the electricity also kept having brownouts, which they explained was how things were in costa_rica, but this didn't happen anywhere else...not even remote cloudbridge. and whenever it did go out, the a/c made a loud noise (woke me up at night), plus it risks damaging an electronics charging. i like firm beds, but this bed was rock hard. and if you need to check out before you leave, there is no secure place to leave your stuff - it worked out fine, but having a locked room for luggage storage seems pretty basic to me, and given how many empty rooms they had, seemed ungenerous to not offer us some secure storage. finally, the power outage turned out to be from a neighbor kid messing with their breaker, and my boyfriend overheard a tense conversation in spanish with the hotel owners, and the kid and his mom - essentially, it was clear there was animosity between the american hotel owners and the nearby costa_rican business owners, but their summation was it was ""nazi neighbor kids"" which struck me as a pretty shitty thing to say about what appeared to be legitimate grievances (the neighbors were mentioning trash, water + electricity usage). and we were wrongly told by one employee that it wouldn't be worth it to take a cab one way to the waterfalls because the driver would rip us off and charge $60 - we almost didn't bother, glad we tried anyway because the cost was just $10. so while the location was excellent, and the garden very lovely, i wouldn't stay there again. 

anyhow, dominical was a laid back beach which was nice, but i found the vibe a bit odd - it struck me as two separate worlds, one of american/euro tourists/expats and one of costa_ricans, and that the two words don't mix much and that there is a bit of tension between the two. for example, besides what we overheard at the hotel, there was an anti-tourist protest sign in spanish at the beach. 

still, we had a wonderful time. for food we enjoyed el ricon so much we ate there both nights, and the breakfast we had at caf√© ensue√±o was one of our favorite breakfast - the homemade chorizo was excellent. both places also had excellent smoothies. we had coffee at mono congo, which i thought was pretty mediocre. 

we did a mangrove kayak tour with rafiki which was great - you start out on the savegre river, going down some easy class i rapids, then you get really deep into the mangroves - our guide had to hack away at some when the trail got a little too narrow. saw lots of shore birds, a crocodile, and some monkeys very up close in the mangroves - and our first and only sloth. 

after the morning kayak tour, we went up to manuel antonio (the city, not the park) for a half day to playa biesanz. very touristy area to be sure, but a very pretty beach - like the caribbean in that it was clear blue water that was very calm. the cab from quepos bus station was a bit overpriced at $10, but whatever, it comes with the territory. i'm glad we didn't stay in this area, but off-season it was nice for a short visit. 

another day we visited the nauyaca waterfall - we hiked the whole way from the ticket office. the paved road part is steep, and you will sweat on this hike, but if you time it right you'll be okay - just bring enough water. the swim at the waterfall is very refreshing, and we saw a good bit of wildlife along the hike - including a scarlet macaw!

we did a day trip to uvita for a whale tour. we went with bahia ballena kayaks. all the tours seem more or less the same, but i think it's worth asking what boat will be use, and how many people will be on it. a fair bit of our tour was spent seeing caves + a brief swim as opposed to just looking at whales, which i suppose some people like, but i would have preferred more whales - we did see two mother whales with their babies, one that got very close to the boat, which was awesome. also dolphins and a two sea turtles mating. overall worth doing even if a bit pricey ($75 each). the rest of the day we spent on the beach in the park - this was my favorite beach of all we went to, and i wish we had more time there. you could easily get past the breakers and be in relatively calm water (at least, comparable to the atlantic in the us), and there is so much marine life on the beach (snails, crabs, lizards, crocodiles, etc.) it really feels more wild than any of the other beaches. even though we didn't quite catch low tide enough to walk all the way out to the whale tale, just standing between the waves going different directions on the sandbar was cool. 

# alajuela 

we just had a night and a morning here, but enjoyed our brief stay. alajuela city hotel & guest house was excellent - very friendly staff, 24hr desk service/check-in, and a beautiful old building with a very comfortable bed. and quite a good price at $45. we went to dinner at nearby pesqueria da limonta, and this was the best food we had our whole trip. if you like grilled octopus, highly recommend this place. the next morning we strolled around the different parks, the market, and visited the history museum which is really close to the hotel, is free, and we found very interesting - some of it is in english, but it helps if you know spanish as not everything is translated. plus you can climb onto the roof and get nice views of the city and surrounding mountains/volcano.

alright, i've written a lot - suffice it to say i really enjoyed this trip! happy to answer any questions.",1,2732
9 Days in Costa Rica: La Fortuna/Arenal and Drake Bay,"trip dates: august 8-16

hi! i got so much out of this sub when i was trying to plan my costa_rica trip that i wanted to try my best to contribute. i agree with u/matanishu that reading other people's trip reviews and itineraries was most helpful so here's a rundown of my 9 days.

my goals for the trip were to see as much wildlife and nature as possible while also relaxing a bit. the hardest part was narrowing down where to go! the most frequent advice here is to not spend too much time traveling between cities and instead enjoy the cities themselves. having gone, i agree with this but it was very hard. i made 6 different itineraries. my partner and i ended up choosing la_fortuna/arenal because it seems to be a must do in cr. then i was inspired by u/np2fast and his [amazing wildlife photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/te3hhf/thanks_to_this_sub_for_all_the_help_in_making_my/) to go to drake bay as a less touristy adventure. 

i hope this helps others! wish i could have spent more time there but this was still the trip of a lifetime.

day 1: flew into sjo around noon. customs took about an hour. carlos aka u/arenalrides was already waiting for us. he was so easy to contact via whatsapp (+506-7170-9978). i had contacted him a few weeks prior, and thankfully he was available. he sent a paypal link for $20 for downpayment/reservation and contacted me the day before to ensure there weren't any changes to the plan. amazing communication, friendly, and significantly cheaper than the other shuttle options i saw on other sites. would recommend and would definitely book again. (as a side note, if you don't have whatsapp, i'd consider downloading it before going. a lot of the tours would message me on whatsapp the day before to confirm times, tell me what to wear/bring, etc and it was super easy for me to ask any questions.)

carlos drove us to la_fortuna. we checked into hotel villas vilma, which was cheaper than other options in the area. it didn't have any hot springs but it had a nice pool, jacuzzi, and view of the volcano. we ate at soda el turnito across the street (best natural juices we had the trip) then hopped into the jacuzzi to wind down for the night.

day 2: we went to the hanging bridges at mistico national park. there was an option to add roundtrip transportation from our hotel for $20 per person, which was great. we also opted for the guided tour, which was a must in our opinion. especially because this was our first park, having a guide gave so much rich background and helped us see so much wildlife we never would have seen on our own. i swear everyone in costa_rica has superhuman vision - their ability to spot wildlife was uncanny. the guide found things with her bare eyes i could barely see with the telescope. indira, if you're reading this, you were the best!

after lunch in the city, we went to bogarin trail, again [recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/costaricatravel/comments/oschjk/10_days_in_costa_rica_la_fortuna_monteverde/) by u/matanishu. we opted for self guided this time and thanks to the other people in the reserve, were able to see so many sloths. if you're worried about going to cr without seeing a sloth, definitely go here. i think we saw about 8 including a baby! i also saw my first agouti, which was so cute.

after this tiring day, we purchased a day pass at los lagos (not available online, just go to the reception desk) and enjoyed dinner and the many hot springs. neither of us being quite instagrammable, this was perfect for us - a lot of hot springs without the big price tag of tabacon or ecotermales. it was $16pp or $17pp if paying with card.

day 3: adventure day! we booked a [canyoning / white water rafting combo tour](https://www.waveexpeditions.com/product/rafting-waterfall-rappelling-adventure-combo/). the canyoning is actually with puretrek canyoning and the white water rafting was with wave expedition. both were so scary but so fun. hotel pickup and dropoff as well as lunch were included in the price. after that, we got a couples massage package at arestetic spa then had dinner across the street at la cava - get the mojito tico!

day 4: carlos picked us up promptly from our hotel and drove us back to sjo (thanks again!). at sjo, in order to avoid an 8 hour drive to drake bay, we took a 45 minute flight on sansa. despite being a little nervous about the single engine plane, the flight was smoother than most i've taken in my life. if you're going this route, might want to book at least a few weeks in advance as they only take a few flights a day and each plane seats 12.

in drake bay, we first stayed at cabinas manolo - highly recommend. we were able to get laundry done here, get taxis ordered for us, and the views of the bay were amazing. despite being farther from the ""centro"", we agreed afterwards that we'd rather take a $5 taxi in and out of the centro than stay at places in the centro for double.

we had a chill day at the beach and ate nearby at casa gitana. since the pineapple in cr is so fresh, we decided to get the hawaiian pizza - yum!

day 5: went snorkeling at ca√±o island. i wanted to go with yemanya tours but they didn't have the minimum reservations needed. i was surprised that they offered to reach out to other companies on our behalf since it was the day before the tour was scheduled, and alexa found us a different company to go with. i'm forever grateful because swimming with the sea turtles and swimming on the beach at ca√±o island is now a core memory. lunch was included in the tour.

dinner was at the restaurant at the hotel called claudio's. this ended up being our best meal in cr by a landslide. love the costa_rica ""pura vida"" lifestyle but unfortunately when translated to cooking, this usually meant significantly overcooked food. at claudio's, although the prices were a little higher than other restaurants, it was worth it to have extremely good food.

day 6: corcovado national park!!! in order to maximize our time with wildlife, we opted for an overnight tour which stays at sirena station. it was pricey but i feel it was worth it. it has to be booked in advance as the company has to arrange passes with the np ahead of time but the locals we talked to (both here and in la_fortuna) stated this was the best place to go for wildlife, which was validating. got to see tapirs, all 4 types of monkeys in cr, wild hogs, agouti, coati, and an array of birds. the food in the park was surprisingly good. sleeping in bunks made me feel like i was at summer camp.

day 7: more hikes in the national park. the boat back picked us up at noon, and we got back to town at 1 where another lunch was included. since it was whale season, we were able to see humpback whales and their babies both on the boat ride to the park and back.

day 8: flew sansa again from drake bay to sjo. got an uber to our last hotel xandari resort, which was a luxurious restful end to the trip. we tried out 2/3 of their pools and 2/2 of their jacuzzis. we also went on a little hike they have on their resort to one of the 5 waterfalls. this was the next best food we had in cr.

day 9: early flight out of sjo back to the us.

if i had more time, i would have tried to squeeze tortuguero in there, which was the next most recommended place by locals for wildlife, particularly now during turtle season. hope this was helpful! feel free to ask any questions and happy planning!",1,1337
Costa Rica Tips!,"i just got back from my first time in cr (la_fortuna, monteverde, and miramar), spent a week there. this sub was so incredibly helpful when planning my stay, so i wanted to give back and offer a few tips i picked up! 

1. omg if you are looking for a ride from sjo to la_fortuna (i‚Äôm pretty sure he does private rides elsewhere too, but he lives in la_fortuna) hit up carlos!!! (yes the carlos that‚Äôs been mentioned before on this sub). he was so incredibly helpful and friendly and made the 3 hour ride feel like 1 and gave us local tips and suggestions! he even saw us walking in town one day and scooped us up and brought us back to our hostel just as if we were old friends üòä 

2. fortuna was cool but 3 days felt like more than enough for me (lil touristy and city like, but great intro to cr), wish we spent more time in monteverde. 

3. usd and cc is good for bigger things or places, while colones is good for sodas and smaller things. 

4. driving there was not nearly as bad as some people on this sub made it seem. the drives were lovely. if you‚Äôre a competent driver, you‚Äôll be fine. that being said we used vamos and they were great, as others have said. they even dropped the car off for us in la_fortuna for $75. 

5. please bring bug spray!

6. offline google maps worked perfectly, no issues. 

7. didn‚Äôt get a sim, just relied on wifi. had no issues there either. plus a great way to be present ;) 

i‚Äôd be more than happy to answer any questions :) pura vida!",1,290
Vamos Rent-A-Car was exceptional again,"if you are traveling to costa_rica through san_jose, and you need a rental car, i recommend going with vamos. i have done business with them twice this year, and both times their service and vehicles have been exceptional. this time i got a toyota prado turbo-diesel 4x4 and it had no issues on or off-pavement.

i paid $950 for 9 days . this included the full insurance coverage, and a shuttle from the airport. i ended up dropping the back wheel into a drainage ditch and almost flipped over.. pretty crazy, but 4x4 got me out and left a scratch on the back bumper. no problem, insurance covered all damage.

the rental car made day trips between la_fortuna, jaco, and uvita no problem at all. also having it we were able to access airbnb homes that required 4x4 which was pretty rad. if you can split the cost between a few people, it becomes very affordable, so consider it next trip. driving is really really easy, especially on the pacific side, where roads seem to be kept in much much better condition.",1,185

My Entry Experience From Oct 31,"wanted to update everyone on my trip yesterday. this is approximately my 10th time entering costa_rica. the only time during covid. and my 4th flight overall during covid. 

flight: direct from ewr to sjo. they checked my qr code and for a return flight. process was slow but not hard. on the plane you have to fill out an additional form about your stay, symptoms, and previous health issues. it is in spanish only so if you don‚Äôt speak, make sure you have a translation app downloaded for the flight. no one ever took the form from us so i have no idea what it was for. 

insurance: bought cigna global insurance and canceled my obama care as this has me covered in the us and cr for the same price. requested a letter from the broker that states covid was covered and had that printed out for immigration. i did not enter with lodging insurance. instead i got a letter from my landlord stating that i was staying from my entry to exit date in a single occupancy room and had paid up front for my stay.

return flight: booked a return flight for ~80 days  after entry that i have canceled. since i entered on or before oct 31 i can stay till march 2 but am not sure when i‚Äôll leave. 

immigration: after going through what i assume was a temperature screening (you walk past some machines and cameras maybe) you enter immigration. i was asked for pretty much everything they could have asked for: qr code, health insurance, return ticket, my job, exact address where i was staying and even looked it up on google maps (this has never been asked before). i had everything printed. the officer seemed to aprox√≠mate that and went easy on my. my friend, who‚Äôs spanish is not as good as mine (mine isn‚Äôt great) was pulled aside to a different area where they asked the same questions again.  don‚Äôt know why. but if you can practice your spanish and have everything easily accessible it will make it easier for you i think.

Our trip to La Fortuna and Manuel Antonio (2nd Part),"manuel antonio:
- when we first arrived here we were really really bummed that we had left la_fortuna because we had loved it so much, that we had a very skewed opinion on it. however it ended up growing on us and we ended up really enjoying our time here. the first thing that i wanted to point out is that the entire town of manuel antonio is built on a mountain side. so if you don‚Äôt have a car, you are either taking the bus or walking up and down hills everywhere. also everything here is more expensive. prepare to spend way more per day on food and everything else as it‚Äôs catered more towards the tourism. the weather said rain every single day we were in the area but literally only rained a little each morning and night. we had perfectly clear skies during the day every single day so don‚Äôt worry too much about what the weather says but definitely pack a rain jacket just in case. totally cool experience though and we would definitely come back but both agreed we wouldn‚Äôt spend more than a few days here. 

the food:
- el avi√≥n: this place was rated really high on everything we read regarding food in ma but it was absolute trash. the best thing about this place is the view and the monkey‚Äôs that play in the trees literally right by your tables. one even swung off the light directly above the table next to us. other than that i would never go back here. very expensive too. 
- cafe milagro: coffee and breakfast was delicious, as well as the fresh juices. we ended up here 3/4 night we were in ma and loved it every single time we went. the french toast was killer.
- emilio‚Äôs: a little more expensive but the view here is outstanding. i would go again purely for the views. coffee and breakfast were good, but again it was a little more expensive and ‚Äúupscale‚Äù if you will. 
- soda sanchez: small little spot in quepos that had some really good local food, the patacones were delicious and the casada pollo was really good as well. 
-samui: this thai food restaurant was great. we came for dinner one night and happy hour another day. pina coladas were shaken, not blended and i will tell you right now it was the best one i‚Äôve ever had. beautiful view with macaws flying right out side. incredibly nice staff and delicious food.

activities:
- beach: playa espadilla norte is the most common beach but you go north to find less of a crowd if you want. there‚Äôs a cool little spot we ended up at that had a umbrella‚Äôs and chair to rent for the day (like $15) and surfboards/boogie boards if you want. there‚Äôs a small road in between the igloo huts and the super jordix, you take that and park for free anywhere on the side of the road and walk in. there‚Äôs also a beachside restaurant that will come around and serve food and drinks as well. 
- manuel antonio national park: this place was truly an unbelievable experience. the beaches are stunning and the wildlife is incredible. we opted to do a self guided trip here and i‚Äôm glad we did. there is so many guided groups that you will almost always end up seeing what they are all staring at, and it was nice having the freedom to go and do whatever we wanted instead of following a group. we hiked all over the morning and then ended up on the beach for the rest of day and it was incredibly relaxing and beautiful. beware of the monkeys. they will literally take your stuff if you are not careful. we watched it happen several times. only reusable water bottles allowed, and fruit and sandwiches are the only foods you can bring in. also there is no chairs or anything at the beaches here so you have to pack whatever you want for a beach day in with you. 
- this was pretty much how we spent all of our time here in ma was beachside or hiking around the park and it was super nice, like i said we would absolutely come back but probably only for a few days! be prepared to spend more on food and everything and just know that it‚Äôs way more touristy than other places. also people try and sell you stuff constantly on the public beaches. it‚Äôs their way of live but sometimes it‚Äôs gets to be too much. one of them even started massaging my wife‚Äôs legs after we said no multiple times, she literally had to get up out of her chair and walk away. 

overall our trip was seriously one of the best ones we‚Äôve had traveling so far. we both absolutely fell in love with costa_rica and completely enjoyed our time here in both places we visited and we both cannot wait to come back and explore other areas! hopefully this post helps answer some questions you might have, or gives you some ideas and i aight on what to do and our expect!!",1,868
Driver recommendation,"just returned from a 5 day trip to costa_rica- first thank you everyone for recommendations! 

second, we had a referral for a driver who we really loved. hired him for the drive from liberia (airport) to la_fortuna then the next day. he made the drive in from the airport really great, stopping at some points of interests for us to take photos and see a little bit more of costa_rica. things we would have never known about or done if we had rented a car or taken a shuttle. he took us to local spots to eat and recommend some as well for us which all turned out really delicious. he then drove us to playa de coco for the end of our trip. his name is errol villegas. you can find him on instagram at @transporte_villegas. he also has whatsapp posted there to contact him.",1,149

My top recs for La Fortuna,"hello guys, i just concluded my 7-day trip in la_fortuna costa_rica. here are some of my thought/tips.

for private transport and tours, i highly recommend going through this company. they were communicative through whatsapp and offered big discounts if you paid in usd vs card. they arranged our private transport from sjo to la_fortuna with ease.

the link to their tours is on top of this post. 

1. exchange usd to colones. the resturants also accept usd but they might not have enough change in usd. most restaurants also accept card. 

2. check out eccocentro danus for their birdwatching tour. one of our highlights. ask for elias. 

3. eat at sodas which are traditional costa_rican restaurants. afforable and large portions. our fav sodas in town are soda viquez, soda hormiga, and soda lulu. surprisingly, they have vegetarian/vegan options. 

4. uber takes a while. whenever we tried to book one, it would take 30 mins. we ended up asking the venue to call a cab for us. transport could be pricey. a ride form la_fortuna to tabacon one way is about $15. 

5. walking in downtown la_fortuna at night is safe. the streets were well lit and city center was vibing. 

6. many many souvenir store in downtown la_fortuna with roughly the same prices. our fav one that has many local artists' artwork which was called original grand gallery. 

7. other fav excursions were safari float tour by canoa aventura, rio celeste and volcano hike, hanging bridges by jungle tours.

8. best massage ever at arestetic spa 2 with a 2-hour couples package for only $145. 

9. if you wanna go to tabacon, book early! they are limiting the number of people per day. people showed up with no reservations and were turned away. we thought it was worth it for the price. the facility was gorgeous. 

hope this helps!",1,316
Costa Rica honeymoon - Help!,"i'm getting **so** overwhelmed with booking my honeymoon trip to costa_rica so i figured i would post on here to get a little help. 

we are planning a 8 day trip in march and would like to go to at least two different areas. we like hiking but aren't like the primitive camping type of hikers. i would say a little more than the average tourist hiker. we're not really into zip lining because we're both not into heights like that. i really want to see the forests and wildlife as well as experiencing the beach. i'm a huge water and swimming person especially in nature sources so somewhere that i could be in water would be amazing. i also want to experience the local food and culture. we also are an lgbtq couple if that changes anything. 

anyways, i hope this wasn't too vague but any advice on places to stay, food to each, where to go, or anything would be so helpful. **thank you!**",1,167

"Mild phobia of bugs, there I said it!","would like to preface that i went back and fourth about writing this post for days. i feel embarrassed and anxious knowing that i am deeply privileged to be able to travel, and particularly to a beautiful country with a diverse rich ecosystem. 

ok that all said. my husband and i love to hike, be outside, i studied spanish for most of my adult life- and we thought costa_rica would be a dream place to visit. after weeks of planning, i started feeling a dark cloud of thoughts coming over me- i have a mild phobia (or very strong distaste) of bugs. living in a city, and hiking in cool weather areas we never see them. the more planning i did, the more i realized we would be  surrounded by large bugs and the chance of them being in our hotel rooms, on us were high. i'm sorta panicking and i realize this sounds crazy to most people on this thread.

my question is, is it common to see large bugs, roaches, scorpions in your hotel rooms (ie bathrooms?) again, i understand we are in their home. we chose this trip, i should have thought this through more. at this point, everything is booked - there's no turning back. but if there are any helpful tips, words of comfort, maybe experiences? i would appreciate this so much- it's our honeymoon and i really want to enjoy it.",1,238

Just got back from 8 day trip + some tips,"just got back from an 8 day trip from sjo‚Äî>la_fortunate‚Äî>monteverde‚Äî>quepos/manuel antonio and wanted to share a few things.


‚Äîcustoms took two hours to get through after landing at sjo, so figure a long wait once you arrive.


‚Äîwe rented a car from sixt, which was fine in terms of the rental, but there is insane construction on the road to get out of the rental place out of san_jose. what should have been a 2.5 hour drive to la_fortuna turned into 4.5 hours. the shuttle also never showed up bc of the aforementioned traffic. they ended up refunding us for a taxi, but we had to call.


‚Äîdefinitely download waze and whatsapp before going. airbnbs and tours all sent links using these.


‚Äîhire a guide/book a tour for any parks. you won‚Äôt see anything without  someone pointing them out! highly recommend a night tour.


‚Äîif you are going to monteverde, get the awd. and plan on trips taking twice as long as waze says it will take.


‚Äîemed worked great with zero wait time. i had to show the results during checkin for my flight and that was it.


‚Äîwear pants and a long sleeve shirt for white water rafting. my group used three different brands of waterproof sunblock and we all burnt to a crisp with the constant dunking. we knew we were in trouble when we saw all the guides in long sleeves :d


‚Äîbugs weren‚Äôt really an issue. we used repel while on wildlife tours, but we weren‚Äôt really bothered even not wearing repellent.


‚Äîwe had clear weather until about 4pm every day. then downpour‚Äîsometimes it only lasted for a couple of hours, sometimes all night. we booked all tours for early morning starts.",1,290
Jungle/treehouse stays?,"i‚Äôm heading to costa_rica for a couple weeks and i‚Äôll be staying in the arenal, manuel antonio, and monteverde areas. also guanacaste but haven‚Äôt nailed down where exactly yet. does anyone know of any hotels/rentals that feel like they‚Äôre up in the trees or at least the most ‚Äúone with nature‚Äù as possible? i‚Äôm not really too concerned wether the place feels rustic or if it‚Äôs modern - as long as it‚Äôs in the trees i guess.

i traveled to africa a few years back and stayed in a safari lodge with the same type of vibe that i‚Äôm thinking of and i would really like to find something similar in costa_rica. 

if anyone has any recommendations off the top of their head in the areas i‚Äôm going or nearby, they would be much appreciated. 

thank you!",1,139
ESIM is the greatest thing I didn't know about.,posting this because i had no idea about it and this post is related to newer iphones (though i'm pretty certain this feature is available on other phones).  phones have the ability to operate without a sim card in the sim slot.  they have electronic sim versions (esim) that allow you to free up your sim slot to put in a sim card for whatever country you are in and allow you to have your primary account electronic and your second account (presumably a pre paid travel sim) as a physical card in the sim slot.  pretty awesome trick i didnt know about.,1,103

"Travel Tips, Advice & Personal Experience - 18 days in Costa Rica","pura vida!

me and my wife recently travelled to costa_rica for our honeymoon. it was our first time and i wanted to share our experience and places we visited. i know currently the borders of costa_rica are closed due to the pandemic, however i hope this post might help someone in the future. i hope everything gets back to normal as quickly as possible and people can enjoy this amazing country. i want to cover in this post our experience with some of the questions which we had before we travelled. just to be clear these are our experiences and advice.

a quick personal note, i have been to many countries around the world, but the people of cosa rica are the friendliest and nicest people i have ever met. thank you ticos and ticas!

we travelled in the beginning of march have spent around 18 day travelling around the country. here is our itinerary below.

san_jose (1 night) tortuguero (2 nights) arenal/la_fortuna (4 nights) monteverde (2 nights) montezuma (4 nights) manuel antonio (5 nights)

we wanted with our trip to explore the country half of our trip and for the other to have more relaxed beach time. i have not details in terms of activities in each area as there is plenty online, however if you have any questions please leave a comment and i will try to reply.

**organised tours.**

we used costa_rica expeditions for our trip to tortuguero. everything was organised from the moment they picked us up from the hotel until they dropped us in arenal. we flew early morning from san_jose to tortuguero. costa_rica expeditions were really great in all the services and i would highly recommend them. in tortuguero we spend two nights at the tortuga lodge and gardens. the lodges are great and they offer a lot of tours which you can take advantage off, if not there is always the pool to relax next to. we did a lot of tours as we really wanted to see the nature. the lodges are on an isolated area from other hotels and you need to take the regular boat to the town. there are long paths which you can walk and see wild life in the area of the lodges. they offer for free rubber boots, walking sticks and ponchos for the walk. the lodges are surrounded by beautiful gardens with humming birds flying around, iguanas causally relaxing on the tree brunches, howler monkeys, birds and other animals. while having breakfast we saw pelicans fishing and dolphins in the distance. all the meals were included in the package which for us worked well as we did not to worry to find a restaurant to eat. this is the only section which we had an organised tour and i would recommend it, you can organise everything yourself however for the price and services we thought it was a good idea. it really depends on what kind of traveller you are.

**renting a car & driving.**

we rented a car from our last day in arenal and dropped it at the airport at the end of our trip. i rented a basic four door front wheel car from adobe rent a car. everything was fine with the car and the service. one thing which i really got frustrated about was the fact that we had to pay $1000 usd deposit which was not indicated in the reservation. to make matters worse i forgot my credit card at home and i had to pay with my debit card, which based on adobes t&c it can take up to 21 days for them to return my deposit. we got back last week and i still have not received my deposit. i did pay for the full insurance as i always do, however they did not even bother looking at the car when i returned it in san_jose. the guy said all good and printed me the final invoice.

in regards to the driving we did not have any issues at all. we drove around 1000km from arenal > monteverde > paquera(ferry)> montezuma>paquera>manuel antonio > san_jose. drivers are also very tolerant and disciplined. overall roads are in perfect conditions (better than the uk), smooth surfaces all the time. only in two places we had gravel roads.

the last 1/3 from arenal to monteverde, the road from puerto nueva to monteverde is a rough road. it takes around 1 hour and we drove 20-30km per hour. personally i would advise you to do this road during light, we left it quite late and we drove in the dark while raining. not great. the second road which was not tarmac and very dusty was the road from cobano to montezuma. they were working on the road, so i guess it will improve in the future. both roads were perfectly fine to drive in our 4 door hyundai. i cannot speak for all the roads in costa_rica but the ones which we did were fine. i know some areas will require a 4 wheel drive, the best thing is to research before you go.

in regards to google maps, do not follow it. sometimes google maps takes you on the shortest distance road which is not the best quality road. follow the main signs on the street and always ask the hotel for the road to your next destination. the rent a car company were nice to give us a free map of the country.

*ferry puntareas to paquera.*

we took the ferry and booked the tickets online. if you are planning your trip to montezuma, the ferry saves a lot of time. here is the link i used to buy the tickets - [www.quickpaycr.com](http://www.quickpaycr.com/) . when you buy online just show the reference number to the guy at the entrance of the ferry terminal.

speed bumps, yes there are lots of speed bumps mainly in town. the yellow paint which they used to have is kind of gone so take care and always check the signs of the speed.

there are also lots of pedestrians and cyclists, mainly in smaller towns and villages. keep an eye of them, especially if you driving in the dark,

the guy from the rent a car company told us not to park on yellow lines as they take your number plate and you have to pay a fine. this did not happen to us, but we always parked where there was no yellow line. as long as you are careful it should be fine.

fuel is really cheap (compared to the uk) and easy to fill up. usually there is a guy filling up your car so just give him money and all sorted. one thing to flag here in the uk petrol is typically green in colour, however in costa_rica the green one is the diesel.

*parking in manuel antonio*

here is the only time i got annoyed while driving. if you go by car to manuel antonio national park it is good to know that there is no official car park. we have heard stories that there is one, we never found it and the officials on the entrance said there isn‚Äôt one. when you approach manuel antonio fairly aggressively people will try to stop you and tell you to park in their spot. literally they will go in the middle of the road and blow a whistle and try to stop you. just ignore them and drive closer to the national park (or beach). we parked 20 meters outside the entrance of the park on the left hand side, the guy charged us 4000c. i think there might have been cheaper places, but we managed to park in the shadow and i honestly could not be bothered to look for 1-2 dollars cheaper. it was also close to the entrance. another thing to have in mind for park manuel antonio is that you buy the tickets from the bank just outside the entrance, people will try to sell you tickets outside. the ticked was 16 usd.

we have read a lot about parking and safety in costa_rica before we went there. specifically not leaving any valuables in the car, and how if you leave valuables will be gone when you come back. to be honest i think that is a general advice that you would get anywhere in the world, not to leave valuables visible in the car. if you leave your phone or camera on the seat, i would say anywhere in the world, you are just asking for it. i personally when we went to manuel antonio beach left my camera and two lenses in the boot of the car. i don‚Äôt think anyone saw me putting them there and they were there when i got back. the topic of car safety while traveling is quite important, however as long as you assess the risk, and don‚Äôt park in any dodgy looking places you should be fine. and to stress i would take this advice for traveling anywhere, not specifically for costa_rica. overall we felt pretty safe all the time and we were never scared or worried for something.

**uber vs taxi.**

we used uber in san_jose to get from the airport to the hotel and couple of times in the area of arenal. it was as pretty much anywhere in the world. i prefer to use uber as i know the price and don‚Äôt need to think how much it might cost. the driver had a new car, did not speak much english but had a good choice for the radio. i cannot comment on taxis as we did not use them.

**exchanging money.**

we exchanged couple of hundred usd at the airport, there is a bank called bac, their exchange rate was really good. they are located in the departures are on the upper floor of the airport.

you can pay with dollars pretty much everywhere, i can‚Äôt remember a place where they said it needs to be in colones. we mainly used our debit card to pay in places, i have a monzo card and was very easy and convenient to use. often you can pay in usd and they will give you colons back. just ask them, they are always flexible and not bothered by how you pay.

**guides or no guides?**

this was a big question for us if we should take a guide during the hikes or can we do it on our own. the guides are expensive sometimes, however i personally think it is worth it. we did in total 7 tours with guides and 3 without guides. every time we had a guide we managed to spot animals and they tell you a lot about the animals and the nature. in arenal i would highly recommend 7 tours, we actually booked it via airbnb the night before the tour. they picked us from the hotel, transport, lunch, fresh fruit and water but most importantly they were always looking for animals and telling us about them. in monteverde, i regret we did not pay for the guide as we really wanted to see and spot the resplendent quetzal. we spend 4 hours in the park early morning looking for it however with no luck. overall i would guess it depends on your preferences and how good of a spotting animals you are. before we went i thought it would be super easy, but actually it was quite difficult.  the rainforest are full of plants and plants grown on plants growing on trees so it was difficult for me spot them. also, a lot of animals to protect from predators are camouflaged so it is even more trickier to see them. we had binoculars as well but it was still quite difficult to spot them. the other good point is that guides tell you about the nature and a lot of information about them.

**food in costa_rica.**

casado and ceviche. that‚Äôs all you need to know and eat. casado is a mixed plate with a sort of meat (fish, chicken or beef), rice, beans, gallo pinto, plantain and sometimes egg. fish was always really fresh and tasty. personally i really liked the casado as it is a balanced dish and i think i ate it at least once per day. no matter of the restaurant they always offer different dishes. we had also international dishes as well, so if you are a picky about your food there will be something for you. another thing which i personally liked was a side dish - yucca pure. what we really enjoyed were the fresh fruits ‚Äì papaya, pineapple, bananas and many others which i don‚Äôt remember their name.

**is the water safe to drink?**

typically in hotels or lodges they will always tell you if the water is safe to drink. if you are unsure just call the reception and they will tell you. in montezuma they said we can make tea/coffe but not drinking the water. i guess when you boil it with the kettle it is safe to drink. bottled water is pretty cheap and on every corner.

**mosquitos and snakes?**

this might not be relevant to some of you, but still was something which might be helpful for some. in regards to the mosquitos we went to areas where the locals said there aren‚Äôt any issues of diseases such as malaria or zika. we bought 2 deet sprays before ‚Äì one was 50% deet and the other 100% deet. we only used the 50% deet which we already felt was too strong for us. it does protect, however you still get bites from time to time. the really nice thing was that some hotels which we stayed had a free natural mosquito repellent. i think it was citronella based and was not as strong as the deet and was actually quite nice and refreshing. we ended up bringing back the 100% deet and half a bottle of the 50%. we also bought permethrin spray for cloths however we never used it.

personally i am terrified of snakes, however we did not encounter any at least close to us. the tour guides managed to spot two snakes on the trees close to the path and we took some pictures of them. they were just chilling on the trees. our tour guide was an older gentleman who said that in the area of la_fortuna/arenal in the last 25 years he has heard of two snake bites of tourists. the general advice you will get everywhere is walk on the paths and do not touch anything in the nature, not only because of the snakes but also because some plants might be poisonous.

as you can tell we were quite worried for the two however i think it was unnecessary and everything was perfectly fine.

if you have any questions about hotels, trips or anything feel free to drop a comment below and i will try to answer it.

thank you costa_rica! pura vida",1,2525

Costa Rica trip January 9-18th 2019,"about me: i‚Äôm a 24 year old male who lives in upstate ny. i‚Äôve only ever been to canada and various states in the us & this was my first time traveling outside of north america. i went with my girlfriend and we had a really great time in costa_rica. i‚Äôll explain more about the trip below with more details and recommendations.

trip planning: 
* we got our tickets 6-months in advance and was able to get them for **$400** each.
* rented a car from vamos- a 4x4 vehicle which had an ‚Äúopen‚Äù trunk in the back opposed to a closed trunk in a sedan. rental was **$403.55** for 9 days.
* we had a suitcase and 1 carry on each.
* **our trip route/loop:**
* +liberia airport ‚Äî> la_fortuna ‚Äî> tenorio volcano national park‚Äî> la paz waterfall gardens ‚Äî> poas volcano ‚Äî> jaco ‚Äî> manuel antonio ‚Äî> tamarindo ‚Äî> liberia airport

**liberia airport:**
* we landed in liberia where we got a shuttle to vamos a few minutes down the road. we then traveled to **la_fortuna**.
* the car was definitely not as modern as my car in ny, but it was able to get me to where i needed to be with no problems. 

**la_fortuna:** (4 nights)
* this town was probably my favorite part of the whole trip. very beautiful nature here. the atmosphere was relaxed, the humidity was dry with warm surrounding heat; very relaxing.  everyone we met was very nice and the food everywhere was absolutely delicious.
* we stayed at **casa luna hotel and spa** which was really nice. they had jacuzzis, a pool, and a fantastic breakfast. for 4 nights the hotel was **$470**.
* don‚Äôt keep anything in your car at night as people generally recommend on here. i saw a guy grab my handle nonchalantly as i was eating at a restaurant at night in downtown la_fortuna. downtown areas can be sketchy at night and i recommend eating in a place where you can keep an eye on your car. outside of downtown feels really safe though. 
* **restaurants:**
* + gecko, pollo fortune√±o, restaurante rio lounge.
* **places:**
* + **la_fortuna water fall**- this was one of the highlights as you could swim under the waterfall and it was really enjoyable just swimming and walking around after. we went across the river to the hiking area which isn‚Äôt recommended, but definitely worth it and not hard at all. at the top you‚Äôll have a view of another waterfall and chato volcano.
* + **tabacon resort and spa** - this place would be worth spending some time at if you want to relax and have fun. the hot springs are amazing, especially at night.
* + **el silencio park**-  instead of arenal. a tico recommended me to go to this park instead of arenal and it‚Äôs a few bucks cheaper. this park was great imo. we had a nice walk, view of the lava fields and the arenal volcano.

**tenorio volcano:**
* this was a beautiful national park. the water was ever so blue and we even saw some [coatis!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/coati)
* definitely worth checking out.
* we ate at a restaurant nearby and it was also incredible. they only spoke spanish, so if you don‚Äôt, download google translate and/or ask for wifi.

**la paz waterfall gardens:** (1 night)
* this was another beautiful park with lots of neat things like waterfalls, an animal reserve, and an old town! we took pictures close up with the sloth, and the toucans!
* we ate here and the food was pretty good and convenient.
* we stayed at a nearby hotel called **altura hotel**. it was **$125** for the night.  this was a really chill place that has sort of a hipster vibe going with incredible views outside. they have some dogs, and when we went out at night we saw a sloth sleeping upside down above the road! it sort of looked like a bee hive!
* **restaurants:**
* + el churrasco 
* +la casita del cafe (amazing view)
* **places:**
* + poas volcano
* + la paz waterfall gardens

**poas volcano:**
* this volcano has 2 lakes and a chance to see them if it‚Äôs not cloudy as hell. either way, a good excuse for a small hike. 
* register with the **sinac** before you go so they can keep track of people. if not you may not be able to go up. 
* after this, we went to **el toledo coffee plantation** and had a coffee tour which was very informative and interesting!

**manuel antonio:**
* if you‚Äôre looking to see monkeys, i guarantee you‚Äôll see them here! there are **howler monkeys** and **capuchin monkeys** which you‚Äôll see near the beach.
* you‚Äôll also see **iguanas** here too!
* bring your swimming suit as there is a nice beach there. 
* **restaurants:**
* + el avion (amazing view ) this place has a giant airplane in the restaurant and you can even sit inside of it or enjoy your meal with an amazing view on the deck.

**jaco** ( 2 nights)
* we stayed here at **oceano boutique hotel & gallery**. it was **$245**.
* seemed like a party town and there is a beach nearby but we didn‚Äôt really visit. 

**tamarindo:** (2 nights)
* we stayed at the **best western** which i really enjoyed because they have a restaurant there called the **crazy monkey** where there is a huge party every friday, a pool, and free rental gear for the beach which is within walking distance. it was **$200** for 2 nights. 
* we went horse back riding during the sunset and that was super fun. the tour guide was through **kayak club** for **$30**
* this is a party / surfer town and was one of the highlights to the trip if you enjoy the beach.
* this is 1hr from the liberia airport which made the end of the trip really easy going.
* don‚Äôt forget to wear sunscreen.
* you may see some monkeys here, and sea turtles as well during march-may.
* a local told us to go to playa conchal and that it‚Äôs really beautiful there.

other info /feedback:
* sometimes it felt like we were the only people at some places like el silencio, and there was a point at la_fortuna waterfall where i was the only one in the water. so in other words, it‚Äôs not packed with tourists. 
* buy some fruits here as they are much better than in the us.
* try a ‚Äúsquare banana‚Äù if you have the chance because they‚Äôre delicious.
* don‚Äôt leave things in your car & don‚Äôt go around sketchy places at night like side roads in downtown areas. there are punks that have nothing better to do and it‚Äôs better if you don‚Äôt get into any trouble.
* talk with people out and about your travels. a lot of them are there to do the same to you and you may just get some insight you won‚Äôt find in the internet!
* some other places on the pacific coast i‚Äôve heard about were montezuma, flamingo, and playa conchal.
* we carried our valuables in our backpacks for the most part which felt safer than leaving it at the hotel which would also be fine too.

overall i really loved this trip and it was an incredible experience that i‚Äôll never forget. the ticos were very nice and welcoming and the country was astounding with the abundance of nature and beautiful views. 

let me know if you have any questions for me. hope the information was helpful! cheers!

"Only 3 full days in Costa Rica, what would you do?","after reading through a lot of posts, i know i am going to sound crazy looking for advice and only having 3 full days.
(yearly, i try to go somewhere i‚Äôve never been to with my best friend and costa_rica has been on top of her list for years. we finally booked the flight for june! the caveat is that we do only get these precious few days.)
we have done other countries or several countries in this time frame but i am seriously struggling with planning costa_rica.
at first i thought we could go to three different zones and base camp at san_jose. so northern zone one day, guanacaste another and carribean or the southern another‚Ä¶
but it looks like that might be crazy and with the roads in costa_rica - impossible.

how would you spend the 3 days?
(besides totally relaxing and eating all day. because yeah, our vacations together are never that way, maybe some day)",1,163

My 10 day trip to Costa Rica with my girlfriend + my 10 day itinerary,"hey everyone,

i made a cinematic video of costa_rica while i was there with my girlfriend, i enjoyed the country do much, it was beautiful and full of adventures. i would appreciate if you check my video out, i like to make these wherever i go to. in the video description you can see my 10 day itinerary of my trip, its 90% accurate, but of course we couldn't be on track the whole time. the trip was awesome and i added at the end of the video a couple tours and guides that i think are a must for anyone visiting. 

pura vida!

Our 9-day June travel itinerary,"pura vida! my partner and i just got back from an amazing 9 days in costa_rica. i‚Äôm offering our recent travel itinerary in hopes that it might help others decide. this sub was a huge help to me before going. let me know if you have any questions or need specific recommendations based on where we went.

day 1. flew into sjo around 9am, picked up our rental car and hit the road for la_fortuna. gorgeous drive and good roads (just bendy). enjoyed the ability to stop when we wanted for small waterfalls, lookouts, snacks, etc. in fortuna we stayed at the arenal country inn. small casitas set in beautiful gardens and adjacent to a river for exploring. 

days 2-3. la_fortuna. 

-mistico hanging bridges in the morning with a guide. stunning views of arenal volcano and great wildlife (get a guide!).

-bogarin trail. self guided this time. many interesting plants and animals (and tons of red poison dart frogs). probably would‚Äôve seen even more with a guide. 

days 4-5. monteverde (santa elena). another lush drive from fortuna, except very bumpy. stopped at a coffee plantation on the way. stayed at monteverde villa lodge; cute place and excellent staff. explored town.

-selvatura park ziplining. insanely fun. apparently the longest zip line in the country. 12 total lines thru the rainforest. 

-night tour, with guide. great variety of animals and unique experience.

days 5-7. guanacaste. drove from santa elena to playas del coco. this was the first place we weren‚Äôt fans of. felt like a dumpy venice beach, ca. we instead went just south to playa ocatan which was sensational. night and day difference. we stayed at the hotel pura vista, a 10/10 place (think infinity pool with a view you won‚Äôt forget). 

-explored various beaches in the area. remember: all beaches must be publicly accessible in costa_rica, no such thing as private. checked out playa cabuyal, papagayo peninsula, playa hermosa, playa ocotal, and playa pez vela. pez vela was my favorite, even though it was small. the dark black sand was interesting. 

days 7-9. manuel antonio. drove down the coast and stopped at the alligator bridge and walked carara national park (both shortly before jaco) to break up the drive. more great wildlife. manuel antonio itself is hilly with many angles and sunset views to chase. 

-manuel antonio np. did two different days trips here, one with a morning guided tour (again recommended) and one without. spent beach days at two different beaches. teeming with wildlife. running out of adjectives to describe the beaches!

-have lunch on the patio at el avion restaurant. interesting history and better views. 

day 9. drove from manuel antonio to sjo for our early afternoon flight home. were treated with a departing gift of macaws and toucans right in front of our airbnb, a converted shipping container. 

hopefully this is helpful. hard to capture just the main highlights‚Ä¶there is so much. happy travels~

general recommendations:

-bring binoculars

-bring waterproof jacket or poncho, not ‚Äúwater resistant‚Äù

-bring at least 2 pairs of shoes (you‚Äôll want to alternate when one pair is inevitably wet)",1,520

If you tested positive in CR: How did the health ministry check in on you?,"hello everyone\~ 

for those of you who have been through the cr quarantine process recently, i have a question: how does the health ministry check to make sure you are being compliant with the quarantine order? 

**my situation**:

i tested positive at the airport a few days ago after 12 days in cr, and am now quarantined at a hotel as instructed. (before anyone scolds me, i'm vaccinated and boosted with moderna. i live in a very large north american city where i know many, many vaccinated and boosted people who have caught omicron, so i purchased trawick travel insurance ahead of my trip to be safe. glad i did - it covers everything!)

**reason for asking**:

 i'm not asking this because i plan to break the rules, but for more pragmatic reasons: my phone and internet connectivity have been inconsistent at this hotel (and throughout my trip to cr in general) and i'm worried that i will have an outage if/when the ministry of health tries to get in touch. i purchased a local sim card but my phone is apparently locked. 

to reiterate, \*\*i am interested about what other people have experienced during quarantine\*\* with regard to health ministry follow-ups after receiving an isolation order.

 i kindly ask that others resist the temptation to leave generalized comments like ""if you follow the rules you will be fine,"" which seems to be a pattern in these threads. i am sure that many people are in a similar position as mine right now, and would like to hear a more substantive answer to this question.

ABBOTT BinaxNow‚Äôs NAVICA IS ACCEPTED - Alaska Airlines 2.26.21,"i‚Äôm at lir airport, just got to my gate waiting to board home to los angeles. 

tldr: the alaska airlines ticket checking counter woman asked if i have the app before i even showed her it when it was time to check the covid test result at the counter. 

she said she loves it and its so easy & convenient. that there is navica and another app that allows for this conveniency & ease. so she doesn‚Äôt have to compare & check the name & all the personal information. ( this is where i‚Äôm not sure if navica is connected to the airlines where they share data with all the personal info already )


so i‚Äôm going to be posting a link to these screenshots/ photos i have of the entire process since it will definitely help someone who has questions. i had such a hard time finding details.

detailed directions:

bring it with you on carry on.  you need a laptop not a tablet. (i brought my tablet because i thought it‚Äôs suffice but when i browsed the web it said mobile device detected)

create an account & make sure all the info is correct.

do not open the new boxed test until a telehealth proctor instructs you to. 

when you‚Äôre ready to take the test, go to emed.com & click start test. 

wait for a telehealth proctor to talk to you. your face will be shown on the video screen. (you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre disconnected if you disappear)

make sure u have stable wifi . luckily i had 2 tests with me so i had a backup when the first test disconnected me -_-‚Äú‚Äù

they will instruct you to open the box and go thru each individual step with you. both your face & the entire test kit must be visible to the test proctor in the camera. 

you will first open the test.

scan the qr code.

open both sides of the test to lay it flat since it was folded in its original form. (its like a 2 in x 2 in square)

drop 6 drops of the liquid into the top hole that‚Äôs smaller. you might be asked to count out loud or not (i was asked to my first time but not second time)

swab the cotton swab in each of your nose 5 circle times. starts with one nostril then the other.

insert the swab into the bottom hole. timer for 15 min will start & they tell u u can leave and come back but u must be back before 15 min because you have to show them the result in the camera for them to witness a negative test result.

one red line = negative
2 red lines = positive

after 15 min countdown, they ask u to show the test in the camera. 

immediately you will get the test results. if u dont within 15 minutes, call them.

easy af

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-----------

i texted alaska airlines support chat to ask first. i suggest if you want to make 1000% sure it works, contact your airlines directly. mobile app connected covid tests seem to be very popularly known by now!!

"12 Day Trip Review (La Fortuna, Monteverde and Tamarindo)","i used this sub a lot to help plan my trip and found posts like these helpful so hopefully this can help people with their planning as well.


**days 1-5**: la_fortuna

we opted for shuttles/taxis/ubers instead of renting a car and used a private shuttle with ilt to get from liberia to la_fortuna. our driver was waiting for us with a sign when we landed and it was a 3 1/2 hour trip with a strop at a restaurant with a great view of lake arenal.

in our first day we used jungle tours to do la_fortuna waterfall, volcano hike, mistico hanging bridges and free hot springs. it was the rainiest day of our trip so we were unable to swim in the waterfall due to stronger currents and couldn't see anything when we got to the view point of the volcano hike. still had a great time despite the rain. however it's too much to pack into one day as by the time we got to the hanging bridges they were beginning to close and our guide rushed us through the trail while skipping 3/6 hanging bridges. 

we spent a day at tabacon hot springs and it was well worth it. it's not even close to comparable to the free hot springs across the street. it really is beautiful and a perfect way to spend a day relaxing and unwinding. it was sold out of day passes that day and still felt very private and not busy. it was very easy to find a pool to ourselves wherever we looked.

our last excursion was white water rafting with arenal rafting and it was one of the highlights of my trip. so much fun and the tour company really took care of us here. i'd recommend wearing a rash guard as it was a lot hotter and sunnier on the river than la_fortuna and even waterproof sunscreen will wipe away quickly on the river.

our accommodations were split between selina and arenal glamping. selina was good for what it was and we met some great people while there. arenal glamping is beautiful and felt very peaceful as there's only 8 tents on the entire property. it's about a 20-30 minute walk to town or a $2-$3 uber. they also offer food delivery options so you can stay on the resort for dinner if you'd like.

my favorite place for food was soda y tortilleria el comalito. they had the best empanadas i had on the entire trip and the people working there were genuinely interested in getting to know us. anchio had really good pasta and balcon sports bar has a good view of the volcano if the rooftop patio is open.

speaking of volcano, you will be lucky to see it in its entirety on your trip! we spent 5 days here and there was only one morning when the entire volcano was visible with no clouds, it lasted about an hour! other than that there were always some clouds blocking the entire view of it.

overall la_fortuna was my favorite spot on this trip. the town is beautiful and i can't wait to go back. yes there are a lot of tourists but the people who serve the industry all seem so happy to do so and make it feel very authentic. 

**days 6-7** monteverde

we took the van-boat-van to get to monteverde. it took 5 hours door to door and i was amazing by how many people were using this route on any given day. 

we splurged here a bit to stay at a beautiful airbnb which had the nicest sunset views i've ever seen. we were a 30 minute walk from downtown santa elana or a $5-$8 dollar taxi ride.

we explored the santa elena cloud forest which was beautiful. the forest was amazing and it was not busy at all. on our first trail we only saw two other hikers the entire time. visibility was limited from the observation tower but it was cool to really feel like you were in the clouds. it cost us $5 each to take a shared shuttle from our airbnb to the reserve. 

next we walked 5 minutes down the hill to selvatura adventure park where we did the zipling and hanging bridges. the ziplining was beautiful and i'd recommend spending the extra $15 to do the last line superman style. the adrenaline rush was crazy! the price of a return shuttle is included in your admission

we ate at taco taco, treetop restaurant and gustico's. all 3 were good and while treetop was expensive it was a cool experience.

overall a fantastic time in monteverde. i'd recommend that anyone sees it at least once but i'm not sure it warrants a longer stay or a second trip back. also, it really does get cold in the cloud forest!

**days 8-12** tamarindo

the shuttle from monteverde to tamarindo took 5 1/2 hours which was longer than we expected. i loved our time in tamarindo but it was my least favorite stop of the trip for one reason only. the amount of people constantly trying to sell you things!! you will be approaches constantly and sometimes aggressively no matter where you go. it made it hard to enjoy ourselves at times and is the number one reason i will not return there. 

i thought the beach was nice but be ready to spend $20 if you want to rent an umbrella for the day (there is essentially no natural shade on the beach). i didn't realize how far the tide goes out so it was cool to be able to walk out far into the ocean. again, be prepared to be approached all day with people selling things. 

we did scuba diving with be water diving and it was better than expected. visibility wasn't the best but we saw a sea turtle, sting rays, puffer fish, angel fish, schools of fish and tonnes of star fish. also constantly heard whales but didn't see any. i'd highly recommend be water if you want to dive here as it is a much more personal experience than some of the bigger companies. it was only the two of us diving with two guides so they were able to point out lots of creatures to us that we would have otherwise missed.

everything in tamarindo is more expensive so be ready for that. the thursday night market was a good time where i had the best slice of pizza on my trip. there aren't many sodas and even the cheaper places were $5usd for an empanada. the food truck court was good as was the outside foot court. we had dinners at el chiringuito, jaguar and la argentina. jaguar was overpriced and the fire show was okay at best. el chiringuito was my favorite and had the best view of the sunset. la argentina had the best pasta i had on the trip.

we stayed at selina and it was a dump compared to their la_fortuna location. it's located in a good spot but that's about all the good i can say about it. accommodations in tamarindo aren't cheap but even if you're on a budget i'd consider elsewhere

we finished our trip with a sunset boat cruise booked through loco tours located close to the food truck court. they had quality drinks, a good meal for us and took us to a secluded beach to enjoy an hour or lounging/kayaking/paddle boarding/etc.

liberia airport is insanely expensive so i'd recommend trying to pack some food before you go. we got stuck there for 9 hours due to flight delays and spent a fortune on food since we weren't prepared. 

**tldr**

la_fortuna is a beautiful town despite being a tourist hub. monteverde is worth the trip if you have time as it and la_fortuna are so different. tamarindo deservedly gets the tamagringo nickname. had a great time there but did not feel like i was in costa_rica anymore.

overall it was the best trip i've ever taken and i can't wait to get back and explore more of the country. i didn't expect this review to get so long but hopefully it can help anyone with booking their costa_rica trip!",1,1385
Which beach towns should I stay at?,"i'm planning for two weeks on the pacific side. i'm an early 30s male, traveling solo. i figured i'd pick 2 or 3 beach towns and find some hostels. i'd like to be able to meet people but i'd also like to avoid anything too touristy (tourists aren't necessarily the problem, it's the catering to tourists that can be tacky and obnoxious). i'd like to try some beginner surfing, i'd like a nice nightlife. i also plan on hitting up a few national parks and doing some hiking - maybe there's somewhere i should stay inland? santa teresa sounds like it was the place, but i've seen some posts  knocking it lately. what do you all think?

Thunderstorms for 6 days,"hi there- my friend and i are headed to la_fortuna for two days and then puerto viejo for four days. currently, the weather is forecasting thunderstorms the entire time we're there (9/22-9/30). i'm a little nervous about activities in thunderstorms. i don't mind the rain but i feel that our swimming and water activities will be limited by the thunder. does anyone have experience with thunderstorms in costa_rica? if thunderstorms are predicted for all days does this mean it will be storming all day every day? i apologize for how naive i sound but the weather greatly varies by country so i'm unsure how to interpret it.",1,109
First trip to Costa Rica. Post trip report #1: Renting a car,"we booked national as their rates seem comparable to local agencies and i am a long time emerald club member.  we also have a corporate account at national and i get an employee discount. it was easy to book a car for the trip with pickup and drop off at sjo.  as far as insurance, the quote from national just plainly said 'included' for both liability and the collision loss damage portions.  i also paid for the rental via amex. 

upon arrival at sjo, i was surprised to learn that i had to take a shuttle although national's information said that their location was at the airport. anyhow, no problem. the service and shuttle was quick. we had booked an suv (grand vitara or similar) and they gave us a toyota rav4 awd. the agent said that it was a better car and i believe him.  no other discussion except explaining how the gps cellphone works, suggestions for lunch and directions to routa 1.  

although the toyota rav4 was a 2022, it felt downscale compared to the models we see in the us and the seats looked tired.  after driving for 8 days, all over costa_rica, i understood why and have no complaints at all about the car.  it kept us safe and took us to many beautiful places safely and capably.

renting a car vs buses/hiring shuttles: this is a personal choice. with a family and kids, we needed the ability to be flexible, make as many trips to the supermercado as we needed, etc. so yes, it was the right choice for us. if you are a confident driver, you will be fine.  if you are not sure about your driving abilities in busy cities, unfamiliar terrain and curvy roads, you might want to think about it.",1,300
Best driver ever + honeymoon recommendations!,"first and foremost, i must recommend our driver carlos! he is friendly, professional, has good recommendations of things to do, and speaks great english despite his claim otherwise. he is very kind and trustworthy, and his suggestions never steered us wrong. he is a genuine good guy who checked up on how our trip was going, even on days where he was not driving us. he is also from la_fortuna, which was our favorite place we visited. 

you can find him on whatsapp: +506 7170 9978

the honeymoon: la_fortuna had great weather, not too hot or humid. personally had great luck with little rain but it was supposed to rain every day. 

we first went to la_fortuna and stayed at hotel arenal kioro. this was my favorite hotel room of all time, with a perfect view of the volcano from the balcony in front of the beds. even carlos confirmed that hotel had the best view. the rooms are all similar, and ours had a hot tub which was clean and a huge plus. huge room, looked great! also the hot springs on-location were nice - many small pools with different temperatures. 
los lagos hot springs - $17 per person entry, $2 towel rental, multiple larger hot springs with more seats and coves and a swim up bar and other such structures. they have hot water next to cold water pools which is nice. they also have regular pools with 2 water slides which were fun! also carlos approved 

maquique adventure: we went on a tour with canyoning and ziplining, they got us super wet via going down a waterfall and ziplining into a body of water, ect. super beautiful with a bit of hiking. recommend by carlos and our favorite activity! 

montezuma: beach town, humid, didn't enjoy the weather. went to ylang ylang beach resort. room was ok, i got spoiled by a big room at arenal kioro. beach was nice but huuuge waves. loved the morning yoga. love the spa. check google reviews cuz some of the tour companies in town are sus. did a bioluminescence tour, beautiful phenomenon, definitely do it! 

ps. i'm vegan and had no problem finding not one but multiple options for food, and found places in both montezuma and la_fortuna that serve a half vegan half omnivore menu, including the ylang ylang's on-site restaurant that has many vegan options. honestly loved all the food i ate.",1,407
Acclimating from a Costa Rican Diet,"hi everyone,

i just spent a month in costa_rica and i loved it! i stayed with a family and my host made the most amazing food (rice, beans, eggs, guacamole, carne, gallo pinto, etc). when i started eating in costa_rica, i had no problem adjusting to the diet; probably because it was much fresher and way better for me. now that i have arrived back in the us, my stomach feels terrible any time i eat anything. [along with some other issues..... you can imagine] other than continuing to eat the way i was in cr, i don't know what to do about this. i saw that it could be travelers diarrhea... 

has anyone else dealt with this before?",1,121

Would Costa Rica (specifically northern half of country plus Pacific coast) be a good place to visit over Christmas?,"hello,

i am planning a trip for the last half of december and was considering going to costa_rica. i was interested in some of the pacific beach towns (like jaco) as well as some of the nature (monteverde, la_fortuna, etc.) along with possibly the southern part of nicaragua.

however i was wondering if this would be a good place to visit over christmas and new years. specifically:

* are things dead over the christmas period? does everything shut down?
* i understand there are a fair number of covid restrictions; have these changed the vibe/atmosphere of the country?
* even though the restrictions aren't too strict (restaurants/bars can still open); have many places voluntarily stayed shut?

overall would you recommend visiting costa_rica at this time? versus an alternative of say, going somewhere else in latin america or south east asia

thank you very much!",1,147

U.S. Expected to Require Covid-19 Tests for All International Visitors - including US citizens returning," 

 the u.s. government is expected to require all international airline passengers to show proof of a negative covid-19 test before boarding flights to the country, people familiar with the matter said. 

the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention is planning to issue its order as soon as tuesday, following weeks of discussions among federal agencies and the white house coronavirus task force. the order is expected to go into effect jan. 26, according to a person familiar with the matter. the cdc and other administration officials were still completing the order.

the cdc order for universal testing of passengers, including for u.s. citizens returning from abroad, comes weeks after the trump administration imposed [a testing requirement for travelers from the u.k.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-require-negative-coronavirus-tests-for-airline-passengers-from-u-k-11608874724?mod=article_inline) over concerns about a more infectious strain of the virus that was detected there. since then, the new strain has been found elsewhere in the world, and [its presence in the u.s.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-reports-first-case-of-new-covid-19-strain-11609281769?mod=itp_wsj&ru=yahoo&mod=article_inline) has been confirmed.",1,157
Any truth in these FB posts?,"anybody heard any more in this information on the facebook posts. 'expatriates in costa_rica' it was also posted on the 'canadian club of costa_rica', but both have now been deleted, but i had copied the text from my friends post on another forum.

"" ryan f lang9 canadians that came in  on a charter at 5pm are being held at the airport. no food, no water, 3  armed guards watching over them.

this because their canadian testing center failed to turn around the 48 hour covid tests in time.

after repeated requests for water, the guards told them they could go to the bathroom and drink from the faucet.

this is not the way to re-open tourism.

does anyone have any media connections? i could put them directly in touch with these 9 people via whatsapp...

Just a little update on some Guanacaste doins,"i live in canas (about 40 min south of liberia) and we have not had any rain since january - except for two brief showers that really didn't even wet the ground.  

until this week, that is!  this is the third day that we have had the ""typical"" afternoon showers.  nice sleeping!  the downside is:  mosquitoes and now i actually have to cut the weeds in my yard.  (i would say ""grass"" but it's really more weeds.)

until recently, we have been lucky in canas to have zero cases of covid-19 but now there are 16!  this is huge.  i think it might be the most cases outside of the san_jose area.  they are apparently tracing it to two sources - a delivery truck driver and one person with many family and friends contacts. they are all now in strict quarantine. (i think my next door neighbor might be in quarantine - he hasn't gone to work in a few days and hasn't left the house.  i will ask him next time i see him in the yard.)   costa_rica hasn't put out any lockdown orders but has encouraged people to stay at home and has put out various regulations that have helped slow the spread of the virus.  

yesterday was my shopping day so i went to the excellent compre bien supermarket and it was very pleasant. and i felt safe due to their protocols.  (wipe the cart with alcohol, give you a squirt of hand sanitizer, all employees either wearing masks or shields, distancing in effect.)  i ended up having to go to several shops and the protocols were kind of all over the place - one clerk seemed a little pissed that i distanced myself from another customer who wasn't wearing a mask.  some of them have pretty strict protocols in place and some of them don't.  the ministry of health has mandated certain things but some supermarkets and shops go beyond that.  lots of people wearing masks.... and lots of people not wearing masks.  of course, gloves, masks, shields, alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer are all very much available now.  

canas is a small city of about 30,000 and is the center of a heavy agricultural area.  not much for tourists to do here - but - it's a great place if you want to spend some time in a non-touristy place.  if you are interested - there's a cattle auction every tuesday and saturday and everyone is welcome.  it's definitely a cultural immersion!  of course, there is the great float trip at rincon corobici and las pumas wildlife rescue center.  i guess most people who have been here just pass through when transferring to/from arenal.  

so yep - it's raining right now.  the first day, i wanted to go outside and do a little snoopy dance in the rain!  my neighbor across the street and i kind of jumped up and down a little bit and did some fist bumps and that was it.

we miss you!  everyone here is keeping fingers crossed that many businesses will survive and thrive later in the year when you guys return - or come for the first time.

got to go now -- have been watching the monkeys in the big mango tree behind my house strip all the mangoes!  hahaha",1,554

Uber at SJO - Our Experience,"we opted for uber on our arrival at sjo to our hotel in san_jose near la sabana park. you have to exit the airport and go upstairs the the departures drop off. the uber driver in our case, was not at the airport but nearby messaging us to confirm we were 'up'. the uber app will translate their messages. once we messaged back that we were up at departures he drove in. we were asked several times along the way to departures if we needed a drive and we kindly said we had a ride on its way. the ride to our hotel was supposed to be about $14 cad. we were however billed that and then an additional $71 cad later on. when i looked in my app, it had our trip extended after our drop off. seems parhaps the driver added an additional stop to our route or maybe an honest mistake. anyway i reached out to uber and explained. i'll let you know how we make out. side note - we used the airport wifi and there was nowhere open for sim cards at 9pm local time.",1,191

Question re: getting around Costa Rica,"hi all!!! we will be traveling in costa_rica in late january 2023.

now i am thinking of traveling around by bus instead? i am just not sure. 

this will be our first time vacationing in costa_rica, and in central america, and i‚Äôm just not sure what to expect.

"We've got 2 weeks booked in Costa Rica in January for our honeymoon, narrowed down our options but still have too much. Help!","we're flying into san_jose, our top priorities are seeing sloths, other wildlife, and chilling on nice beaches (or at waterfalls!). we want to feel relaxed so don't want to spend tooo much of our time traveling, but at the same time have so much we'd love to see.

our narrowed down locations are as follows:

* manuel antonio
* monteverde
* puerto viejo & cahuita
* la_fortuna & volcano arenal

ideally we'd cut one of these areas from our trip. we know it would probably make most sense to drop manuel antonio or puerto viejo in terms of travel time, but they're also probably the two areas we're most interested in going! we're thinking of taking a domestic flight from ma to limon to cut out the huge distance otherwise required to get from one to the other, is this a good idea?

i speak fairly decent spanish having lived in spain for some time, my partner's is quite basic. we're also vegan if that may help influence any decisions. (and also because as a vegan, i am contractually obligated to mention it at any possible moment)

Long customs wait time,"hello from costa_rica! i've been on this subreddit for awhile preparing for my trip. i am here now, so i thought i'd share my experience. we landed in san jos√© on january 5th, and our wait time to get through customs was about 3 hours. there were only 2-3 officers working, and they were working painfully slowly. there were several hundred visitors in line. honestly, it was terrible and forced us to drive to la_fortuna in the dark. not a great first experience driving here!

today has been wonderful, however. we visited mistico hanging bridges and saw lots of wildlife including spider monkeys, a baby eyelash viper and several types of motmot birds. happy to help with any questions.

What should we do in/around Manuel Antonio?,"my girlfriend and i are in ma for one more day & night (we head back the morning of the day after).

throughout our trip in costa_rica, we've done ziplining, a guided tour, a night tour, a coffee tour, sloth trails, a paddling safari wildlife tour, and went to the ma national park, did all the trails and hit all the beaches.

neither of us drink, go out to bars or fancy restaurants (we've eaten at sodas every night). we're also not into flashy things like parasailing, atv rides, or expensive tourist traps like the skywalk.

we don't really have anything left in manuel antonio that we can do on our last day. we've looked into the finca horseback riding and the mangrove kayaking but we're not really into either since we've done the boat safari and the horse riding is kinda expensive.

we're considering hitting the biesanz beach, chilling there, and having a dinner at el avi√≥n to see the sunset. is there some other activity we can do that is low-key/unique/not touristy here? we understand manuel antonio is limited for people like us and we've already done the main thing here but any suggestions (including things in quepos) are welcome!",1,203

Any Americans traveled to Costa Rica recently?,so i‚Äôm headed to costa_rica in a few weeks for a mountain bike race and am wondering if there are any americans out there who had gone recently and what their experience was like. i‚Äôve read that the only requirement to get into costa_rica is to provide proof of travel insurance. did you purchase insurance from the us or one of the insurances offered on the website from costa_rica? did you also need to get a pcr test to get back into the us? any advice greatly appreciated. thank you!,1,93
Detailed Covid Report,"there have been a lot of questions about covid numbers. this is a great site to reference for daily updates. you can also navigate to download and excel and filter for what you‚Äôre looking for. 

keep in mind that testing is wide spread but is different by canton (rules to get tested are different by canton). for example where i am you must have at least 4 covid symptoms to get a test. if you have 3 they will tell you to isolate for 14 days instead of testing you. 

not hating just passing info i have. would be curious what others are seeing around the county from a testing perspective.

Gap Year in Costa Rica," hello all - 

wife & i (early 30's) are looking for essentially an adult gap year from us to cr. we've been twice and loved everything about the country and want to take a step of making a move there for about a year or two before returning back home. 

i work in software from home & can move anywhere that is in us time zone. she‚Äôs currently a dialysis nurse. we don‚Äôt have a huge savings stash as we‚Äôre trying to get to zero debt. i bring home about 7-9k/month after taxes and she currently bring about 5k.

our main struggle is finding some sort of work she could do as getting a work visa for a nurse would probably be next to impossible i've discovered. but we think we could boot-strap, she could find some free-lance jobs online and we think we could get creative to manage through it.

understanding her income would probably take a hit wherever we go, switching to cr tax system probably would be a huge savings for us. would we be  immediately subject to that by converting to residency after move? 

my main question was whether all this sounded feasible and suggestions of places to look into housing? we would prefer living closer to the beaches than in the valley. i've heard finding housing through the rental companies will be much higher so it's better to find someone local and do direct. 

was just hoping to get some tips and suggestions on what to consider as we think about making this step. 

thanks again and hope everyone's staying safe.",1,266

Best Car Rental Experience: Review,"tldr; economy rent a car alajuela. contact jimmy personally

i just got back from costa_rica. before our trip, i read on reddit the horror stories about renting a car in costa_rica and unfortunately the two highly recommended companies were all sold out. 

i found a random reddit post comment (which unfortunately i can‚Äôt find to give credit to that person) who mentioned economy rent a car alajuela specifically contacting jimmy. this was absolutely god-sent and best/easiest experience i‚Äôve ever had.

not only was jimmy responsive immediately on whatsapp, he hooked us up with a brand new full suv (if you are planning to road trip  the country highly recommend full suv) that only had 400 miles on it. he didn‚Äôt require an early payment or anything and said just to contact  him if we no longer needed it (likely because of how high demand car rentals are now).

such an easy process. got the exact price of everything to the penny and gave my credit card letter to waive one of the insurance fees. 

 my biggest advice not just for this rental place but for all is to book directly and don‚Äôt book through the website. jimmy gave us the best deal despite  being in a  high travel season and we saved $600 booking directly versus booking through their online website (i calculated it all).",1,227
Traveling at night from SJO > Jaco as a solo F?,hello! i'm arriving late at sjo (\~9pm) and then need to make my way to jaco where i'm staying at the selina hostel. given the time of day it seems that my only real options would be to either take a taxi or private shuttle. i was thinking the private shuttle arranged in advance via ilt would be the safest option for a solo female (although $$$) but curious on other options i may not have thought of or if it would be inadvisable to travel alone at night. thank you!,1,91
OPINIONS: Monteverde or La Fortuna for Central Mountains?,"my friends and i are going to costa_rica for the first time at the end of april. we have made a general itinerary of: manuel antonio (sun - wed) -> central mountains (wed - sat) -> san_jose (sat - tues). our idea is to have two full days at each stop, with a day of travel between. 

here is our question: monteverde or la_fortuna area for the central mountains? on the map they look close, but the drive time is a different story. the guides i‚Äôve seen generally suggest monteverde as a top place to visit, but as i look at the area, the la_fortuna parks also look amazing (arenal, rio celeste, and juan carlos are calling my name). does monteverde offer something vastly different from the other parks? or would people suggest cutting down on san_jose to do both? it seems san_jose isn‚Äôt normally high on people‚Äôs lists, but i am normally a city person and i‚Äôm seeing some fun stuff (also thinking of driving to see irazu from san_jose).

Best Rides in Costa Rica!,"my husband and i just recently went on our honeymoon to costa_rica, and we stayed in la_fortuna for 5 nights. when we were figuring out our transportation to and from our hanging bridge tour, i remembered the amazing reviews i had previously seen on this subreddit about a local driver named carlos ( u/arenalrides +50671709978 on whatsapp ). on very short notice, i hit him up and asked if he was available to take us to and from our excursion the following day. i got almost an immediate response, and he said he was down! carlos was so awesome, and treated us like friends, not tourists. he is a very safe and reliable driver, and we had fun conversations and an all around great experience with him as our driver, and for a fair price as well! he even went so far as to recommend other tours in the area that were worth visiting! if you're ever in need of transportation, i 100% recommend texting carlos. you won't regret it! i will definitely be calling you when we decide to come back, my friend! pura vida! üíñüá®üá∑ kate & jack",1,192
Travel Anxiety Advice?,"hi!! my family and significant other and i will be traveling to costa_rica in january and i‚Äôm so excited to see such a beautiful country! i‚Äôve always loved traveling and have never been anxious about travel itself or having good accommodations.

Entering Costa Rica with a Felony‚Ä¶ Help!,"hello, i have plans to visit costa_rica through sjo in the coming week. i have a federal felony cannabis possession conviction that is 4.5 years old.  
  
everything i read online and was told by the u.s. state department indicated i would be fine to enter costa_rica with my criminal record.  
  
just a couple days ago i emailed the  c.r. consulate in la and they responded that i would not be able to enter the country until 10 years post conviction. i did not receive an explanation. 
  
does costa_rica really consider cannabis possession a ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù crime and an ‚Äúimpediment‚Äù to entry? do any of you kind strangers have any insight?  
  
i really do not want to cancel my trip, but it if i am understanding correctly, i must do so.  
  
update: 

after contacting a couple law firms in costa_rica for advice, they told me there should be no reason for them to deny me entry, and gave me the confidence to enter the country. i had a great time!
  
i had even received a follow-up reply email from the consulate simply stating that any felony conviction within 10 years would prevent entry. clearly they were giving a blanket statement and not commenting on my specific situation.",1,209

Which city to stay in for a month,"i plan on working remotely in costa_rica for all of august and am trying to decide which city to base in. since i‚Äôll be working during the days i want to be a few minutes from a beach with good surfing so i can surf in the mornings before work. in the afternoons and weekends i want to hike. i plan on renting a car for the whole time i‚Äôm there. 

it seems like jaco would be a good spot because there are plenty of rentals walking distance to the beach and the surf looks pretty good.

it looks like there are a lot of cool spots on the nicoya peninsula but it seems like i wouldn‚Äôt be able to explore the rest of the country because it‚Äôs too far away from everything else. 

manuel antonio also looks super cool because i‚Äôd be close to great hikes but it seems like the surf isn‚Äôt as good as some of the other options.

I would avoid flying Volaris at all cost,"flying volaris to costa_rica was the absolute worst nightmare of my life. i will never fly with them again. 

- they had the wrong terminal on the flight information email, as well as their website
- we were not able to complete the online check in before the flight even after trying multiple diff√©rence devices and desktops. when they asked us why we couldn‚Äôt check in online, they tried to insinuate that it was due to an error on our part, even though we could literally hear people next to us having the same issue. 
- after two hours of standing at the desk, they then decided to tell us that they overbooked, and that they would maybe not be able to get us on the flight. we had purchased these tickets in december ( for a light in late february). the only reason we were able to get in is because we had purchased additional room, so we had established seat numbers. 
- my girlfriend had a carry on to put in the over head compartment, as we are boarding the plane, they do not let her a few others carry it on the plane. they take it from her and say it will have to be put under. i ask pointedly if it will be on the current plane we are on and they say yes ( we had a layover in el salvador but we did not get off the plane, people just got on)
- once we arrive in costa_rica, her luggage is nowhere to be found. us and maybe 6 other people wait in line for 3 hours, standing, as one attendant tries to help us ( she did a wonderful job however ).it was a mess trying to locate her luggage, and we were so confused due to us not changing planes. my gf had zero clothes in costa_rica, besides an extra shirt in my bag. we left the airport after exchanging contact info and where we would be staying. the volaris agent told us to save our receipts if we have to buy clothes ( volaris didn‚Äôt care about that in actuality they wouldn‚Äôt reimburse us for anything) we got to costa_rica on saturday at 11 am, we received her clothes on wednesday night, two days before we were supposed to leave. 

-our compensation, 80 dollar flight voucher‚Ä¶.  absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. i will never fly volaris again.

"Looking to learn how to surf in Costa Rica, which beach do you think I should go to?","hello!

i'm heading to costa_rica this friday, with little to no plan lol. i want to learn how to surf but after a few days of research there are still literally too many options to choose from so i wanted to hear some stories and personal feedback about where i should go. i sorta ruled out the caribbean side cause it's raining for... the rest of the month. which is a shame since i really wanted to go but there is always next time! so far i think i've narrowed my places down to samara and santa teresa/montezuma. samara to learn how to surf and then santa teresa area to chill, continue surfing, and paddleboard.

am i making the right call? is there somewhere else i should go? my original idea was jaco but after some research on reddit (thank god) i was talked out of it. tamarindo i'm conflicted with.. don't really want a cancun experience. nosara i'm just confused. manuel antonio idk.

also if you have any tips for costa_rica in general feel free to pm me. i would love any help. i'm kinda winging this as i go but i guess that's the fun in it. a little about me, i'm solo f(30) and i'm fairly active. i pole dance, grew up competitively swimming, and enjoy paddleboarding. so while these will be my first moments learning how to surf, i feel like i'll be ok? haha.

Can't Check in until Covid test - will we get bumped?,"hello! 

we have a 7pm test scheduled for a 12:30am flight (so, 5.5 hours earlier) - we can't check in to our american airlines flight until we have the negative test in hand. assuming it takes 1-1.5 hours to get results, that means we won't have results until 8:30pm, and that seems optimistic. 

are we running the risk of getting ""bumped"" from our flight because we have not checked in? i'm in the habit of checking in as soon as one is able to online, as i've had family members show up to an airport without checkin in (and yes, two hours before the flight) and get bumped.

A month stay in Costa Rica - where should we stay?,"my friend and i are looking to be in costa_rica for a month and want to enjoy hiking, nature, beach, maybe some surfing but also have the ability to connect with community through some yoga or other mindfulness activities. i literally have no idea on what area to stay. any suggestions? i‚Äôve been to manuel antonio area and enjoyed my time there, would probably prefer something different this time. 

also we will probably rent a car and are happy to send a few weeks here or there and move around during the month.

thanks!!",1,95
Feedback for Honeymoon in Costa Rica.,"hi everyone - my wife and i are planning a honeymoon to costa_rica from may 15th - 23rd.  the following is my current itinerary plan but would love some feedback. we are planning to stay two nights in each area:

* may 15th - 17th: stay in playa hermosa (maybe playa conchal or tamarindo instead?) we fly into liberia
* may 17th - 19th: arenal / la_fortuna area
* may 19th - 21st: monteverde cloud rainforest
* may 21st - 23rd: stay somewhere closer to san_jose, we are thinking the peace lodge at la paz waterfall gardens
* we leave on the 23rd out of san_jose

are we not spending enough time / or too much time in any one area? also, would it make sense to do monteverde first and then arenal/la_fortuna? not sure what is better logistically. any feedback, hotel/activity recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",1,152
Fiance and I land in San Jose in 4 days... trying to immediately head south towards Osa Peninsula.,"we don't necessarily want to be in san_jose for any longer than we need to be, and want to get out of the city-scape as soon as we can. we want to get to osa peninsula for the first part of our costa_rica adventure and are looking for any advice/insight on some nice places to stay while heading south out of san_jose.

is cartago nice? tourist friendly? quepos? any specific reasons to take highway 34 instead of highway 2? i am gravitating towards taking highway 34 and enjoying the coast on our way down to osa peninsula.

Anyone want to do rafting shuttle from Puerto Viejo to La Fortuna?,"my girlfriend and i want to do the gecko trails rafting shuttle from puerto viejo to la_fortuna. it includes transport, 4 hours of white water rafting, and breakfast and lunch. it's $99. they said they can only run for groups of 6 or more, so just wondered if 4 or more people are up for this? we are planning to leave puerto viejo on friday but obviously that's not set in stone and we can stay longer. just seems crazy that you can do rafting for only 32 dollars more than the shuttle!

COVID Travel: Opinions Wanted on When to Visit,"hi all, 

i am a us resident from chicago who has been following the travel guidelines of costa_rica somewhat closely. my fiancee and i planned to go to costa_rica for our honeymoon in january 2021. our wedding is postponed but we still want to celebrate this ""pre"" honeymoon. we are looking at flights right now for january 8-16, 2021. obviously no one has the correct answers here but i would love opinions and suggestions on this timeline. what is the likelihood that americans (chicago is considered low-medium threat) will be allowed in without a 14-day quarantine at the beginning of january? the flights are very reasonable right now and it is the high season so i would love to purchase. i am so wish-washy as so many things i've had planned have been canceled. would love some insight at how costa_rica plans on opening, etc. etc. thanks!",1,150

i've been looking into dentists in cr and many of them are based in san_jose, but we would love to be able to explore the actual beauty of the country instead of staying in the city. there will be recovery and pain from the procedures to deal with, so i'm sure we will be unable to do a ton of high energy activities. i've found a handful of dentists in jaco, tamarindo, liberia. ideally, i'd love to find a holistic or biological dentist in one of these areas (not in san_jose).

do any of you have advice in this area? we would love to explore any hot springs, national parks, coffee/chocolate plantations, that sort of thing, as well as feel taken care of with a good dental team. ideally we would like to travel in late march, if that helps. thank you so much for any guidance you can offer. üíú",1,204

Just wanted to recommend my driver that I found found on this sub a week ago!,"hi guys ,

i spent days researching the best and most cost effective way to travel between difference cities for a small group. i researched the cost of rental cars, mandatory insurance, and gas. i also looked into private and public shuttles. 

ultimately, i found that hiring a private driver was the most cost effective, safest, and fastest way for a group of 3 people or more. i actually found his information on this sub two weeks ago. initially i was hesitant to contact a random number on reddit, but i did so anyway. i am so happy i did because he is the real deal! his name is carlos. he waited for us at the airport with a delayed flight / customs, and also waited 2 hours for us to finish an excursion. he even stopped at local stores on the way to our destination. he speaks great english.

cost:  
$140 to go from liberia to la_fortuna   
$200 to go from la_fortuna to tamarindo  

we were a group of three young women, so if you are like myself and hesitant for safety concerns, he is trustworthy. i felt safe the entire time.

"San Jose airport, money, rental cars, Covid"," just returned from about a month in cr and am repaying some of the good info i got here.

arrival in sjo -  juan santamar√≠a international airport, aeropuerto internacional juan santamar√≠a in the city of alajuela in the san jos√© metro area.

arrived 5pm, first stop is immigration where you show your passport and health pass qr that you got from https://salud.go.cr before you left. the line was long. there was a sign near where i started that said it would be 1 hour from that point. luckily an official motioned me to a short line for wheel chairs and i guess old people, i'm 70. that doesn't always happen - others on the tour older than me had to go through the long line on a different day. if you are old, try asking ""viejo?"" (google for pronunciation if needed) before you get between the black straps. then you get your luggage and walk through the station where it may be searched. then you enter a big area with duty free shops. there was a red atm on the right from which i was able to get 200,000 colones, about $322. you keep going and exit that area with people: people with signs for tours and travelers who have arranged transport and people waiting for travelers they know. i was on a tour so i found my name and the driver took me to my hotel. rental cars, hotel shuttles, taxis, etc. are near here but i don't remember exactly.

money. my advice: use any atm and don't worry about the rate. get larger amounts vs smaller.  details. at xe.com, the exchange rate for 1 usd ranged from 634.211 to 647.313 while i was there, the higher being 2% above the lower. i used 5 atms and got these rates including the fee. airport: 621.21 per $.  pital at 10.4545, -84.2730: 640.71 per $. in a grocery store in santa luc√≠a district north of san_jose: 631.95. santa cruz in guanacaste province at 10.2683, -85.5877: 622.23.  tamarindo at 10.3013, -85.8401 - i got dollars here and paid a $9 fee to get $100, possibly the worst ever for me anywhere but i was in a hurry.  i didn't compare any exchange booths or banks (you would have to carry a lot of dollars to use them for a trip). the problem with atms is they don't tell you the exchange rate. they do tell you the fee for using the atm, but i found that one with the highest fee for colones gave the highest exchange rate so fee isn't helpful for deciding which to use. i couldn't figure the exchange rate until the transaction posted at my bank's web site. anyway, the highest rate i got was 11.67 colones per dollar more than the lowest rate. for 100,000 c (about $150), the difference would be $2.77, not enough to worry about for me, especially since you can't tell what rate you will get anyway. some atms are spanish-only so have your translator ready for the buttons. my card did not work in one atm and another person's card did not work it the one i had just used.

rental car. probably the only thing i don't like about cr is renting a car. the companies quote low rates but when you get there, the insurance is much more than the car. i booked with avis for 11 days after my tour and got a rate of $422. when i got there, they asked where i was going and i said tamarindo and they then told me that if i drove even one mile on an unpaved road, they would charge an extra $1000. i knew i would be driving on unpaved. they didn't have a car that can go on unpaved, an suv, so they took me back to the airport, where i booked with dollar - their printout said $1295 for 11 days but it was $1395 on my credit card statement. this was with using amex premium car rental protection to waive cdw. i'll be staying away from avis. by the way, the drive to the pacific is hard - one lane each way except for a few passing lanes, many big trucks and many cars. it is a long drive even if you do a lot of passing.

leaving from sjo. when i returned, usa was requiring a negative covid test the day of or the day before my flight. i used:

https://www.ict.go.cr/es/documentos-institucionales/material-de-apoyo-coronavirus/pruebas-covid-para-usa/1898-laboratories-authorized-in-costa-rica-for-test-sars-cov-2/file.html 

to find an antigen test. since i had a car, i chose laboratorios labin in the plaza real alajuela shopping center which was near my final hotel and the airport.  i made an appointment at labinlab.com but didn't give my credit card because i wanted to pay the $40 in cash. when i got there, they didn't have me on the schedule but after some begging, they did the test.  in 2 hrs, they emailed to me my negative result with a qr to show at the airport. i was asked to show the qr at the united airlines counter but nowhere else. there is a test site at the airport doing antigen tests for $65, labechandi.com.

Manuel Antonio National Park,"hello! i will be visiting cr for the time at the end of the month, and will be staying in manuel antonio for almost a week. i plan on visiting the park at least 2-3 times for tours and also to enjoy the beaches. 

some questions that i have...

1. should i be buying day passes ahead of time? i thought i read somewhere that the max capacity  for the park fills up quickly... if so what's the most reliable site or place to buy tickets?
2. are the guided tours through websites ([https://manuelantoniopark.com/](https://manuelantoniopark.com/) , [http://www.sinac.go.cr/](http://www.sinac.go.cr/)) or am i best to book or through independent tour guides (air bnb, other guide referred through reddit)? 
3. things to pack for a full day there? from what i see there are food restrictions so i was curious what other do when they plan on doing a full day of hiking and then hitting the beach.
4. i plan on taking taxis from my air bnb to and from the park for the days that i go. is this the best way to go?

all advice and suggestions are welcome!

Odd rental car problem -advice please,"this was our 5th trip to costa_rica to visit my husbads family. we rented from budget, and even though our credit card insurance would cover it, we bought all of the extra insurance offered. ($500). 

we drove from san_jose to los lagos in la_fortuna. on the drive back to san_jose, we had just passed the airport near san_jose, the engine blew a rod. 

after being stranded on the side of the road for 3 hours because no one would answer the 800 number. we got ahold of the budget at the airport location. 

a week after we returned home, we received an email stating we needed to pay $6000 for a new engine in the car. the email said we voided the insurance by driving through high water. 

but their photos provided were not the same car we had. (i took a lot of photos) also, the invoice has a car with a different year/license plate listed. 

we responded by email and pointed those issues out. 

now purco in the states is saying if we do not pay. they will put it on our credit.

thanks!",1,96
Airbnb host asked me to bring lightbulbs,"hello! we are travelling to cr from the us (wa state) in 8 days and staying on the pacific coast, arenal, and san_jose. one of the airbnb hosts sent me a pm asking me if i could give them my address for them to order light bulbs and have us bring them in our luggage. has anyone heard of similar requests? i should also mention that we are each bringing a single carry on for our 11 days there including our hiking gear, so i am not sure we would even have room. does anyone have any insight on how to handle this request? tia!",1,106

Best way to spend a week in August in the Tamarindo area,"i drunkenly bought a ticket to costa_rica aug 14-21 via liberia because it was cheap w/ points and i had a great time last time i was in costa_rica. tamarindo seemed like a good spot to focus my time but i'm open to other ideas.

Buying Clothes,"i will be visiting costa_rica at the end of next month, and i'm thinking about purchasing clothes there from local vendors and wondering about how much the average cost of let's say a t-shirt is? some of the places i will be visiting are arenal, manuel antonio and jaco.   


i'm mainly wondering because on my last trip to thailand i was jumping around from place to place and if i went there again i would only bring clothes for a few days and buy stuff along the way at local markets. it's cheaper than buying clothes in the us, it supports the local merchants, and it keeps my packing light along my journey. however if an average t-shirt is about $20 bucks i doubt i would do much of that at all.",1,133

Record Covid cases in Costa Rica,we booked a trip in costa_rica when the covid numbers were down. the numbers have gone up a lot lately and yesterday they broke their all time high of new cases in a day. our trip is the end of may and first part of june. i'm starting to think we should cancel our trip. i'm surprised there is not more talk of this on costa_rica travel forums and a facebook group i am a member of. seems like a pretty big deal to me. i'm afraid of additional mandatory precautions being implemented because of the big spike in cases further complicating our trip. plus the risk of being stuck over there is also rising.,1,117
Guanacaste- Las Catalinas,"hi! my husband and i are headed to casa chameleon at las catalinas in the guanacaste region of cr at the end of may for 2 weeks.  does anyone know if this area is safe? also, are yoga type leggings and athletic wear acceptable for hiking and daily excursions? i read somewhere that this type of clothing was frowned upon.  we've never traveled to cr, so any insight is appreciated.  is it safe to wear diamond wedding band, or should i take a simple gold band instead?

La Fortuna to San Jose,"good afternoon y'all!

i went to la_fortuna with a friend who drove, and when he left on thursday i thought i had the bus figured out. however, there seems to have been a schedule change at some point, because now the info i'm finding shows a single bus leaves every 9 hours to cuidad quesada, and nobody i've spoken with knows if the bus at 245pm is still running at all. none of the shuttle services is willing to pick up a single traveler, and i can definitely uber if i have to but its 100$+ at this point. anybody want to buddy up for a shuttle, or have any information to help with the public bus schedules?

19 y/o first time solo travel - advice pls!,"so, i‚Äôm planning a trip to the nicoya peninsula for 3-4 weeks in september (yes, i‚Äôm aware this is rainy/low season).

i‚Äôm looking to do a spanish language course, and two have caught my eye, one in tamarindo and one in samara. 
after extensive research on both, it does seem like tamarindo (or ‚Äútamagringo‚Äù) is very very westernised, and samara a more authentic experience. because of the course i‚Äôd spend 3 weeks in one location, and then maybe a few days in the other afterwards.
my worry is that, it being low season, samara may be almost empty? and maybe tamarindo may be more tranquil...

"What would be a fair cost estimate for a month+ of living in Costa Rica as an experienced ""live like a local"" traveler?","right now my boyfriend and i are looking for places to travel from mid-april to the beginning of june. we're torn between mexico, costa_rica and a couple other latin american countries. we work seasonally so we are looking for a place to live/explore cheaper than in the us.

as background we're completely into using local transport, we went over 200 hours on busses down and up the west coast of south america over 3 months. generally we stay at airbnbs, buy our groceries from local markets and eat cheaply most of the time. we're both chefs, we are not at all picky about food and can make groceries stretch. 

my main question about food/groceries is the general price of fish? 

how expensive are busses from city to city?

what do excursions usually end up costing?

i'm also going to be doing school online starting in mid-may. is the internet reliable most places?

we're both very into food/culture more than nature, but of course want to see the whole country. what are the best cities to hang around in for things like museums and cheap but delicious fish markets/restaurants, especially during covid?

thank you costa_rica travel community!",1,198
Extending my stay within the 90-day tourist visa window,"i arrived on february 3rd and originally planned to exit costa_rica on april 3rd, and my passport was stamped as such, noting a 60-day stay. is there any danger in me extending my stay by a week? i'd still be within the 90-day tourist window, but the following article has made me wary: [how to extend your costa_rica tourist visa](https://ticotimes.net/2021/02/03/how-to-extend-your-costa-rica-tourist-visa).",1,62

Covid Insurance - Canadian Residents,"i know this question has been asked countless times, but i wanted to see if there were any updates for covid insurance outside of the local options (ins/sagicor) as these are way too expensive. 

so far, from my research on this forum and others, blue cross seems to be the most reliable option, and is fairly reasonable.  manulife has been mentioned on here as well, but their quote was double the price. i've seen a few posts from others saying they were able to get through with tugo, which seems to be the cheapest option, however their lodging option is $2100 canadian, which falls short of the $2000 usd lodging option. 

so for anyone that has arrived in costa_rica recently, what insurance did you use, and has anyone used tugo, or any other cheaper insurance policies?

How much CR currency should I bring for a 11 day trip?,"my wife and i are going to cr in end of april. basically our itinerary is land in so ---> la_fortuna ---> monteverde ---> manuel antonio ---> back in so to leave.

when we travel we try to pay as much as possible with the cc, but given we are travelling by public bus i know we will need some money. all hotels are paid for, and we might have a few trips already pre-booked as well, but we expect to pay entrance fees in some parks. don't expect we'll do much shopping except maybe a little 10$ trincket.

how much should we bring? i imagine the sodas don't take cc that much, or do they? bigger restaurants would take, right? what about park entrances? i also heard that the exit fee at the airport is payable by cash only?

"When they say, ""You have to have a guide for this"" then get a guide.","a simple story to illustrate what i mean:

a couple was staying at an ecolodge that has a 100+ acre rainforest.  there  are a couple of nice trails through the rainforest and one that is very difficult and not routinely maintained.  the difficult trail is typically muddy and climbs to reveal a pond where you might be able to see tapirs.  yesterday, two people ignored the staff at the ecolodge who told them they were required to go with a guide and started out on their own.  ended up with a call to 911, ambulance, police, search and rescue.....  

please, don't be idiots!  if the staff says, ""you have to have a guide to do this..."" then get a damn guide.  not talking about seeing a sloth or more birds or more monkeys, but about your health and safety and the resources necessary to rescue idiots.",1,146
Active Costa Rica Vacation Itinerary Advice,"going to costa_rica mid december for 11 days, 10 nights (arriving late at night the first day and leaving in the morning the last day, so trip isn‚Äôt quite as long as it seems).  flying into lir and out sjo (opposite of my last cr trip!) 

need help planning an itinerary that will let me and my travel partner do all fun activities we want to try and squeeze into this trip. he‚Äôs used to backpacking trips, roughing it, and being extremely active and i am more used to traditional vacations (staying in hotels, but doing little active excursions during the day). planning on renting a car, so don‚Äôt mind if we stay at a lot of different places rather than just 2-3 spots (like my last trip there.) i realize this will mean a lot of our trip will be driving from point a to point b and we are ok with this being more like an epic crazy road trip!

would like to try scuba diving, surfing, rafting, hiking, mountain biking, maybe zip lining, and relaxing at some hot springs (arenal area!) thinking of an overnight rafting trip somewhere but probably hotels/airbnbs, and hostels rather than camping. i haven‚Äôt been to any coastal locations in costa_rica before, so appreciate any recommendations for unique beach spots that offer a lot of activities, have an authentic costa_rica vibe, and hopefully will let us get by without knowing any spanish (might be able to use our phones to translate but neither of us know spanish.) primarily want to find places where we can explore nature, see some wildlife and experience the more authentic, less touristy parts of costa_rica. (i know arenal area is pretty touristy though, but i enjoyed it last time and would like to try the hot springs... even if it‚Äôs only the free, natural one!)

lastly, i‚Äôve already done monteverde, and leaning towards not renting a 4wd vehicle, so want to avoid any locations or routes that would prevent us from driving without 4wd! appreciate any suggestions for destinations, routes, and particular activity companies (as well as rental car company recommendations.) thanks!",1,358

"My recent trip to Costa Rica (La Fortuna, Tamarindo and Flamingo Beach)","i used this subreddit heavily to plan my trip so i feel obligated to share with you guys!

we just got back from a 10 day trip starting in liberia and driving to la_fortuna (3 days) then to tamarindo (4 days) and then flamingo beach (2 days).

we started from liberia because our alaska airlines companion fare gave us the best deal to fly into liberia.  we decided to rent a car for more freedom to roam and i honestly think it ended up cheaper than shuttle buses and taxis throughout our trip.  ended up using ace car rental and had a great experience, make sure to factor in the required insurance because the original quote is way less than the final cost.  we paid $380 for 9 days and had full coverage with $0 deductible for everything.  they do require a $1000 deductible that will be unfrozen from your account upon return.

the day of arrival we got the car and drove straight to la_fortuna, which was a little sketchy, but we made it just fine.  the only problems we had driving were from cars passing where they shouldn't have. had to slow way down to avoid a head on collision with passing traffic going the other way.  otherwise i'd say it was totally fine.  we made it to la_fortuna and stayed at the green lagoon resort, which was amazing.  nothing fancy, but a great location if you enjoy hiking.  the trail up to cerro chato was one of the highlights of our trip (note: the trail is technically closed, but most people go around the blockade).  we did some ziplining, hotsprings, and hanging bridges while were there too.  expect to spend some money on the admission fees to these things, but if you have a car then you don't really need to spend extra money on the guided tours that you see online.

next we drove to tamarindo, which is a total surfer party town.  we stayed at selina, kind of like a surf hostel that has a bar and party atmosphere going every day and sometimes late at night.  loved the vibe of that place but our stay there was tainted when my gf's expensive perfume went missing.  the town itself is pretty fun if you're into partying or playing on beach.  lots of good food choices but nothing is very cheap.

we ended our trip with a few days at an all inclusive resort in flamingo beach.  this was by far the most expensive part of trip but we thought we'd try it out and wanted to pamper ourselves before returning to seattle.  the flamingo beach resort was cool, but very quite compared to tamarindo.  it was nice to have a cleaner room and the food/drinks were all very good.  i liked the iguanas that hang out by the pool but be careful because my girlfriend did get bitten by one when she tried to give it a french fry!  haha kinda her fault for feeding the wildlife.

hope that helps any of you planning your trip.  i had a great time and i can't wait to go back :)",1,527

Which Arenal Hike? 1968 vs,"hello! i'm trying to decide where to hike around the arenal area:

* arenal volcano national park
* arenal 1968 private reserve
* arenal observatory lodge and spa

my impression is that the national park might have more variety but the 1968 private reserve is not as busy. that being said, i'm planning to arrive early so i'm not as worried about crowds. it doesn't seem like either have particularly challenging trails either. 

i'm interested in great views and i don't mind harder trails (assuming they're safe to do solo). i have time after la_fortuna waterfall on one day and another full day.

would love feedback on what people have heard or experienced!",1,114
Just back from 7 days at Playa Conchal and Arenal,"not for budget travelers, this was a trip of a lifetime for us so we went all out. stayed first half at the westin playa conchal. the beach was beautiful with warm water. the beach is public so there were lots of locals selling goods which we liked. got a wonderful $20 one hour massage on the beach. lots of tour guides will approach you, too, but we had pre booked everything. the resort was lovely, quiet and we saw plenty of wildlife there. the best part was staying at amor arenal. it was the most amazing jungle resort with private casitas and a private outdoor hot tub overlooking the jungle and arenal. can‚Äôt give this place enough stars. we did a day trip to a local farm and learned to cook some traditional foods, followed by a river boat tour. we did the zip line, i wasn‚Äôt a fan! it was pouring rain so it was hard to see flying through the air. i wouldn‚Äôt do it again. honestly i would have just stayed at arenal the entire time, if we return that is our plan. we booked through namu travel and they were great. all the drivers and guides were super friendly and would accommodate stops like grocery stores, banks, lunch, whatever we needed. pura vida!",1,218

Driving at night,"we are planning a trip to costa_rica and i have seen a lot of people advise not to drive at night.  it looks like sunset is around 6p, and we were hoping not to waste too much daylight driving.  i am curious about why people advise against driving at night.  specifically, we are looking at doing the drive from la_fortuna to the caribbean side/cahuita and starting out around 15:00.  thanks for any advice!

Need advice from more seasoned travellers. Is Jaco really that bad?,"i (24f) am going to costa_rica in feb for 3.5 weeks and will be working online for most of it and take 1 week off. my family is coming with me for a week and then leaving. i was initially planning to stay in jaco and use it as a home base and take tours/go to areas close by, since the apartment i booked there was perfect (good wifi, pool, security, good price) but i keep seeing very mixed responses about it. is it really that bad? i‚Äôm not worried about it being too touristy cause i‚Äôd rather be around people/have all of the amenities/restaurants/things to do close by. some people say it‚Äôs ok if you practice common sense and others describe it as a literal hell hole. i just want good food and to relax in between work.

i panicked and also looked at quepos to see if i can split the stay and spend 1 week in jaco and 2 weeks that i‚Äôm off in quepos. i am worried about transportation logistics and wondering if it‚Äôs worth the hassle to move. could anyone give me an advice please? i am slightly freaked out.

edit: the reason why i have to spend that week in jaco is that everything else is booked in quepos for that week",1,219
40th Birthday Celebaration in La Fortuna and Tamarindo - Suggestions,"my wife and i are planning a visit to costa_rica in early june 2023 without our 3 kids to celebrate both our 40th birthdays and 15-year wedding anniversary.

the tentative agenda is to fly into liberia and spend 3 nights in la_fortuna, staying at the tabacon thermal resort and spa and exploring some local hikes and adventures. then head to tamarindo for about a week and stay at the jardin del eden boutique hotel while experiencing the beaches, pool, restaurants, and nightlife the area has.

wondering if anyone has any suggestions for us - must see or do things in these two areas, maybe splitting our time in tamarindo with a third area, good day trips to take from the area, etc. we do plan on renting a car while there.

Looking for clarification on restaurant tipping after reading other posts,"my husband and i just wrapped up 10 days in costa_rica (arenal/monteverde/tamarindo). 

so first, my understanding is that restaurants do not expect an additional tip as the 10% service fee is already included. from reading previous posts, someone suggested that it's best to follow local customs as closely as possible and not tip beyond the 10% service fee as it could put locals at a disadvantage. most of the restaurants we visited, they gave us our total and once we paid, that was it. very simple. some restaurants, however, that were in the heaviest tourist areas presented their receipts in such a way that the service tax is not very visible, not translated, and they included a blank line for tipping. i was very confused. would these restaurants be upset if we didn't tip additional? looking for advice and if possibly i'm overthinking it. 

thanks!

edits: for clarity

update: well, looking at the responses i can see not everyone feels exactly the same, but the consensus seems to be that additional tip is not expected but appreciated. personally, i will maintain my practice of not tipping additional unless i feel like its warranted, and if i do, i will tip cash only. thanks all.",1,205
Driver Option,"after a decent amount of stress with a shuttle canceling last minute and miscommunication with my hostel, i reached out to carlos ( u/arenalrides +50671709978 on whatsapp ) for some very last minute coordination of a private transport from santa teresa to la_fortuna (not the easiest trip for sure).  carlos was able to quickly and flexibly coordinate a trip with two separate drivers and a ferry transfer that would be able to pick me up as soon as 6.5 hours later.  his price was the best private transfer price i had seen.  unfortunately, due to a ‚Äútoo many chefs in the kitchen situation‚Äù on my end, i had to cancel on him soon after booking with him.  carlos was flexible and understanding about it all, but i appreciate the quick solution to my stressful situation.",1,136

5 Days in Costa Rica,"hello everyone!! 

first time posting on reddit :-)

i am going to be in costa_rica from 12/9/22-12/14/22. so, 5 days.

i have been to manuel antonio and i plan to spend the 5 days north of san_jose.

1. one day in arenal: volcano, mistico bridge, aerial tram, la_fortuna, lake arenal. hike 1968,
2. one day in monteverde: hike monteverde cloud forest. night tour, hanging bridge, colibri coffee, horse-riding, tabacon hot springs.
3. one day at poas: la paz waterfall, poas volcano, territorio de zaguates, maybe venado caves,

so far this is all i have planned. i know this is a lot but i plan on waking up around 6 am daily :) 

should i go to guanacaste and spend two days there or should i stick around in the above-listed areas and spend more time seeing volcanos, waterfalls, explore trails?

i did some search and guanacaste has some nice beaches and las baulas national park, but i feel like the drive is long for practically the same stuff or less. the beaches are great but the water is cold. i live in fort lauderdale so going to the beach is always an option.

flight back is on the 14th around 1.",1,204
Itinerary Help!,"my husband and i are traveling for our 10 year anniversary with the following schedule:

* tues: travel to la_fortuna at 8am
* tues - thurs: stay at tabacon. this is our splurge hotel/luxury spot for our trip.
* thurs-fri: stay at arenal observatory. friday we are going zip lining.

this is where i have a question. our current flight is 6am sunday. do we transfer back to san_jose friday night and have a day in san_jose or stay in arenal friday night and shuttle back to san_jose saturday morning just to be there the day before our flight? we thought we'd like to spend a day in san_jose to explore the city a bit or even just walk around to see what it's like, but the more i read here the more i see people are saying it isn't worth it.

Costa Rica and kids (2-7 year old). Some questions regarding stuff availability and things to do.,"hello all,

we are 8 adults and 6 kids (age 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7) traveling to costa_rica for 7 nights in about 3.5 weeks. we are staying for first 3 nights near la_fortuna and last 4 nights at an all inclusive (riu palace).

q1) for the 2 year old, we would need diapers. what is the price for diapers in costa_rica compared to us? we would be flying in to san_jose and i believe there is a walmart right outside the airport.

q2) do you recommend any spot to see or eat on our way from  (a) san_jose to la_fortuna (near chachaqua rainforest hotel to be specific).
(b) between la_fortuna and riu palace.
caveat: we're all vegetarians.

q3) what activities do you recommend for a group like ours? we are thinking of going to white water rafting half adults one time and the other half the other time. do you recommend any level 2 ones in the volcano or riu palace area?

q4) any other fun activities if you can recommend for a group like ours, optimally that we all can do. we will have 3/4 cars so transportation should not be an issue.

Maquique Adventure Canyoning Review - a Must for Solo Travelers!,"i know i want to do canyoning/rappelling because i have never done it before and i like to try new things. the cost is quite high ($95) so i looked into rappelling/canyoning in the us and in the us it would cost even more and not as fun. there is no place in the us that i can rappel directly down under a waterfall and not just next to a waterfall, and there is no rappelling in the us that is 60m (200ft) tall neither. i looked into other rappelling/canyoning tours in la_fortuna too but decided to go with this one because other places require at least 2 people to book a tour and i'm a solo traveler. besides, i would get the most out of my money with this one (5 rappels and 2 ziplines!)

the tour was amazing! there are actually 3 ziplines and one of them has a surprise twist! they didn't mention this on their website or in their video/pictures to keep it a surprise so i won't say it here neither. but i went to xplor park in cancun and did plenty of ziplines and this one was still the best because of the surprise factor  üòâüòâ. besides the 60m waterfall rappelling where the waterfall water splashes into your face as you try to control your descent down a rocky waterfall, the walking part from one rappel location to another was the most challenging partüòâ. if you are an adventurous person, you will absolutely love it!

a surprise perk i didn't know when i booked with maquique canyoning is that they take video of you rappelling for the last 2 rappels and send it to you for free! there is no extra photo package you need to buy. as someone who travel everywhere solo, i didn't have anyone to take video of me doing adventurous activities for me, and even if spend a few hundreds $$$ to buy a gopro, a gopro will only record what is in front of me and not me myself doing the activity. so having the tour company take videos for me was a huge plus!",1,357

Quarantining experience,"i'd love to hear from folks who have been required to quar after getting a positive test.  


my family (wife and 2 kids age 7 and 9) are wrapping up our stay with a couple nights at planet hollywood (don't judge).  


i spoke with the resort, and they said that they offer covid tests to guests for the day before their departure.  if any of us test positive, they will put us up in their quarantine wing for something like $125/n.  **however we are not allowed to leave our hotel room** for the 14 day period.  


i'm all for combatting the virus etc (whole family is fully vaxxed and boosted) but have you ever been locked in a hotel room for 14 straight days with a 7 and 9 year old?  i mean...i'm legitimately worried that we will all murder each other.  


so our plan is to test somewhere other than at the resort, and if we test positive, immediately find accommodations somewhere where we can isolate but still be able to go outside.  i'm thinking like some small hotel off the beaten path with standalone units, or an airbnb somewhere.  


what have people's experiences been, and is our plan feasible?",1,201

Confusing (and slightly frightening) experience with Uber around San Jos√©,"we just came back from a 5-day trip to costa_rica, and i wanted to share my experience driving with uber.

a bit of context: we stayed in san jos√© (san bosco). we didn‚Äôt feel confident enough to rent a car, so the plan was to make 3-4 day trips to the places of interest (parks, beaches, coffee plantations) using taxi services. 

we also heard a few warnings against using local cabs, so we decided to just uber everywhere.

now, here are things that have happened:

- twice upon arrival a driver would tell us he only accepted cash. okay, that‚Äôs no biggie, although inconvenient sometimes. 

- once a driver said his uber app wasn‚Äôt working properly, so he switched it off and just put google maps. it was supposed to be a trip to braulio carillo park, but as we started approaching the park, he lost signal (so did we) and said he wasn‚Äôt sure where to go. then he added it might be dangerous for us to go there by ourselves, even if he would wait for us at the entrance (that‚Äôs in case we find it) because tourists often get robbed there. long story short, he convinced us to go back to the hotel. that was 3+ hours in a car and 35000 colones cash (although the view from the window was breathtaking!)

- another driver also got lost despite the app navigator, so instead of spending 2-2,5 hours on the way to manuel antonio, we spent 5+ hours, and it was off-road (again, the views were incredible though!) 
oh, and during that ride, we were briefly chased by a man with a machete after trying to ask him for directions.

- whenever we tried to call uber from around a bus station, drivers would often cancel before arriving. we were then explained it was an unsafe place for them because local drivers hanging out at the bus station sometimes are aggressive towards uber drivers.

at some point, we found a nice and friendly uber driver who offered his services to drive us around and wait as long as needed. we agreed, but during the ride i got paranoid because i found 2 plastic zip ties behind the backseat. because it was also in the area with no signal, i freaked out and canceled further rides with him. perhaps, i overreacted, but if you‚Äôve read the previous paragraphs, you may understand why. 

now, i understand that it‚Äôs our responsibility to plan rides more thoroughly and probably we should have printed maps and probably we should have rented a car in the first place. 

but damn! 

did we make some fundamental mistake or were we just unlucky?

upd: thank you all for your tips. 
bottom line for those who‚Äôve stumbled upon this thread: if you‚Äôre for any reason uncomfortable driving yourself (which would be the best option to explore cr) keep in mind that uber is typically used for short rides only. for longer sightseeing rides, get a shuttle or contact a local agency.",1,506
