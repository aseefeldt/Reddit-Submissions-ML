Looking for Costa Rican Spanish speakers for an online study on speech perception and production,"Hey guys! I'm a linguistics PhD student and I'm doing a study over speech perception and production for native Spanish speakers living in Costa Rica who have studied or learned English (you don't have to be an expert or anything, only understand it at a basic level). The study is over how speech sounds are produced and perceived across different languages. It's totally on-line, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and you will receive $6 USD via PayPal or Western Union once you've finished!

If you would like to participate, or know someone in Costa Rica who would like to participate, send me a message, leave a comment here in this thread, or follow the QR code listed below! Thanks!! :)

Traveling to CR as a tica...,"Hi! I am Costa Rican-American but have never been to Costa Rica (or Latin America at all, for that matter). Although my Spanish isn't completely fluent, I spoke it at home growing up, so I use some tiquismos and have the accent a little (the ""r"" lol). 

I've had an urge for a while now to visit CR and try to connect better with my heritage. Are there any tips for first timers? Or even others who were in a similar situation? Maybe other latinos from the US who have traveled there who can share their perspectives? 

I am also not very well traveled, so I have a little anxiety about being somewhere new for the first time. I believe I have distant family still in the country, but don't have a way of contacting them or anything, so I'd be on my own in that sense. I do plan on going with my partner, who doesn't speak Spanish at all. Any insights are welcome, thanks! :)",costarica

How much time to get through check-in and airport security on a Saturday?,"Flying out tomorrow 12:35 pm. How much earlier should we arrive at the airport? 2 hours? What is the average time usually from arriving at the airport to make it to boarding?

We are coming from Puntarenas. Travel time by car is 75 minutes, but I like to give extra time. Of course not everybody agrees in the group when we should leave...

Edit: The car trip was 30 minutes longer than expected, but other than that it was smooth sailing. We used Adobe car rental (2 miles from airport) so we gased the car up, dropped it off and their bus was there in 10 minutes or so. 

From the outside of the airport to the gate it took 45 minutes. 20-20 luggage check at Spirit and security and 5 minutes walk to the gate. We ate at Avokato because we got hungry although we didn't plan on that.

Thanks for everyone for the responses, I know we got lucky with traffic and everything, but I had to fight group decision.",costarica
My Parting Tribute to Costa Rica,"Pura Vida Costa Rica,

I'm here to write to you and express my sincerest thanks for my experience in your amazing country. I want to express to you what I think makes the country particularly special within the global climate which I hope serves as a rallying cry for the values which I think are in rarified air.

But before I do that, I'd like to share a little piece on how I came to the country and why I'm leaving it for now. Several years ago, I met the first woman I ever loved. As it turned out, she was Costa Rican and I decided after some time to try and make a go of things in Costa Rica -- previously I had been put off as I was preferring cheaper pastures. That said, I made the move and eventually I came to love the country and the woman. However, years later we've decided to split up and she's kind of taken a hardline stance on me not patrolling the small country as we may bump in to each other. Do I think it's immature and selfish? A little bit for sure. It's pretty unreasonable to ask me to abandon the life I've built and the attachment I have to the country I love, but I'm someone who prefers not to have any drama or problems, and short of that I can see her point of view, and would prefer to avoid the advent of either one of us seeing the other with another person until considerable time has passed and the pain has subsided.

With that backstory I can say my farewell for now and in doing so, talk about what I love about Costa Rica:

\- CR is a Latin American country but not one with all of the typical ailments. For starters, your Police force is truly friendly (albeit at times inept) compared to other Latin American counterparts. When I see a cop I don't have to worry like when I'm in Mexico, fearing a shakedown or exploitation. Whether I had done some sort of minor violation or they were just doing a routine check, they were always reasonable about it. I actually felt more safe around Costa Rican police than in my home country which shall remain unnamed :).

\- Ticos have an amazing sense of humour. I was here across the pandemic and had absolutely nothing to do at one point so I temporarily picked up the nasty habit of Tik Tok. But no regrets with that decision as I'm proud to report Costa Rican TikTok is truly world class. It doesn't matter if it's a prepared joke or just some guy trying to cross a river during rainy season, the commentary is hilarious and ya'll are in a class of your own. I'd also like to note it had always been my experience that ya'll were funny in person, but I guess I didn't put two and two together realizing how much funnier you were until I could readily compare you against other countries' TikToks using a VPN during the pandemic (ya like I said, I had extra time on my hands). I predict an amazing comedian will come out of Costa Rica in the next decade.

\- Ticos are super helpful. There is a special thing that happens when you get your car stuck, all of a sudden there are 12 Ticos there and a 12 pack of Pilsen or Imperial. No, I'm not going to choose one over the other, I think Imperial is better for micheladas though. Moving on, I always appreciated the informal roadside assistance I received.

\- You kept your borders open during the pandemic. Now it may have been for economic reasons, but I assure you that socially this was ultra beneficial compared to the alternative. Please stand by this value of upholding freedom (even if it is in part sponsored by an over-reliance on tourism).

\- Ticas are absolutely stunning and I'm totally jealous.  Not only that, there's a ton of them, there seems to be an abundance of beautiful, single women. Praise God Ticos, ya'll are LUCKY.

\- Costa Ricans are polite. I have always appreciated this aspect of the country. Politeness is valued, there's a certain warm charm here that while maybe not as overtly outward as say Colombia where people like grab you and start dancing, is still quite genuine and refreshing. I love talking to Costa Rican moms and grandmas, they are sweet.

\- Costa Rica has a generally intelligent population capable of discussing a variety of topics with ease. Now I'm assuming some people are somehow going to get offended by this for whatever reason, but let me just say this isn't a given in every country. My home country has difficulty discussing political issues for example as people tend to get pretty aggressive, filled with self-righteous indignation, and defensive, that wasn't my experience when talking to Costa Ricans. I could assert my own views and they were often dealt with diplomatically if even not agreed with (even people say what a crazy dude after I leave). Conversely, it just seemed like most people were fairly politically conscientious and that people are willing to hit the streets for something they believe in. I recall the demonstrations across the pandemic where Costa Ricans were demonstrating against a seemingly absurd rate hike in property taxes and an unprecedented tax for removing your money from the bank. Congratulations Costa Rica, protesting and affecting change as one country is a vital democratic process, do not take this for granted and continue to celebrate it even if you don't agree with the particular reason for the protest. My country has a recent history of shutting down protests through illegal force.

\- It goes to show how much I actually love Costa Rica that I put this so far down the list but obviously, and clearly, your nature and protection thereof is absolutely outstanding. All of the mountains, beaches, rivers, jungles, fresh water -- it's right in the name -- RICA. Your country is rich in nature, protect it at all costs and continue to boot out mining scum who want to exploit you. Watch out for the ""illegal mining"" narrative that is simply trying to act like only ""legitimate mining"" can protect you from this. It's a sham narrative that my home country would stupidly fall for.

\- I like the traditional Costa Rican finca accent and saying ""Costa Shhhrica"".

\- There is no military and that contributes to a peaceful disposition. This is a rarity in the world, and it was courageous step to take in favour of focusing on healthcare and education. It absolutely has helped Costa Rica to develop more of a middle class over its counterparts despite being one of the last to join trade agreements and thus be subject to more unfair stipulations. Never the less, it appears Costa Rica is taking center stage as a Latin American innovator.

\- You had a civil war / disagreement between Grande Mexico and the now Costa Rica which someone won and yet you can't tell the winners apart from the losers. This is an absolute rarity, in fact I've never heard someone discuss this at all. Look how divided the north and south sections of the US are ideologically, yet here in Costa Rica there is no apparent winner or loser -- there is no faction that can be readily identified as having been for ""Grande Mexico"" and I don't think that's because you killed them all (hopefully I'm right). Rather it seems because of the principal of amnesty. Yes, I acknowledge I avoided the subject of the seeming divide between annexed and OG CR parts as well as the forgotten land of Limon. That said, there is still a high degree of unity in Costa Rica compared to other countries.

\- I love the amount of good DJs. Yaya, this new house trend that seeks to form a snobby upper class through music that looks down on reggaeton is pretty annoying to me but I digress. -- there's really good DJs in Costa Rica who do a nice blend of reggaeton, dancehall, reggae, afrobeats, house and the like.

And with that, I say to you, some of the things I've loved about Costa Rica and hold near and dear to this day. To any Tico or Tica idealizing the lands beyond your border just let me say that in my experience Costa Rica is special. If you insist on holding something to an elevated status elsewhere and you think it's something you can't find in Costa Rica then by all means go ahead and explore, but I think you'll come to find in time that Costa Rica is in a bit of a golden age and a goldilocks zone (even historically you guys were just enough out of the reach of both Grande Mexico and Grande Colombia). Surprise surprise the least f\*cked with Central American country also seems to enjoy the best ""karma"" for lack of a better term. Not without its limitations and its problems sure, but that can be said of any country, the general thing of importance is the foundation and the trajectory. 

With all of that being said thanks so much for my time in your country and look forward to seeing ya'll again.

To the g's a cachete and the OG's:

Best Places to Practice Spanish,"Hello all!

I‚Äôm planning on going on a 10 day trip with my family (all adults and teenagers) to Costa Rica in mid July. We would like to stay in an area that‚Äôs a bit out of the way without a ton of tourists everywhere, but not so out of the way that there‚Äôs not much to do and it feels totally deserted. 

Additionally, although I‚Äôm not totally fluent, I speak Spanish pretty well and am really excited about being able to practice my Spanish with natives in a Spanish-speaking country. For that reason, I was looking to stay somewhere that, save some tourists, is predominately Spanish speaking where people wouldn‚Äôt instantly switch into English upon seeing someone who‚Äôs not a local as I heard is common in big tourist areas like La Fortuna and Manuel Antonio. 

I realize that Spanish is much more common in areas of the country where fewer tourists go, which tend to to be the less interesting places (at least in the eyes of foreigners), but was wondering if anyone could recommend places to stay that are mostly Spanish-speaking but still have some interesting things to do and aren‚Äôt so underdeveloped and out of the way that it‚Äôs a major inconvenience for travelers.

I was thinking of flying into Liberia and staying around Playas del Coco/Playa Hermosa (Guanacaste) which seem (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) to have nice beaches and restaurants and a decently developed city and don‚Äôt seem as completely overrun by English speaking tourists as somewhere like Manuel Antonio. I was then thinking of making some day trips to some more remote locations and national parks and one multi-day trip to La Fortuna from this ‚Äúbase.‚Äù I am totally open to new plans if anyone could recommend some better locations, though.

Any recommendations for other areas to stay that are better suited to what I‚Äôm looking for or general advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Moving to Costa Rica for a year, where to stay?","I'm planning to move to CR on the digital nomad visa for a year at least but haven't decided where to stay while I'm there, I could use some suggestions from you fine people!

I am really into nature and wildlife so I'm more interested in access to lush rainforests and good hikes than beaches and parties (though I enjoy those too once in a while). I'll also need to be close to amenities and transportation as I don't drive

Last time I visited I stayed mostly in Escazu, but I'm considering maybe moving around the country, staying at airbnbs in different places for a few months at a time

I was thinking of a few months in La Fortuna,  Monteverde, and also potentially Uvita and Corcovado. Is there anywhere else that should (or shouldn't) be on my list?

And advice would be much appreciated",costarica

Nosara or Samara in Jan with young kids?,"I‚Äôm flip flopping. 

Fam of 4. My kids will be 6 and 4. Plan to stay at one of these spots for a week. 

We don‚Äôt surf. Though I like the idea of trying! I‚Äôve done it once before. Can‚Äôt say my kids will give it much of a try. If anything the little one might be more interested. He‚Äôs not a strong swimmer yet so I don‚Äôt know if I should even try with him. 

Aside from that what‚Äôs best for a young family? 

Things that are important: 
- variety of restaurants within walking distance
- beach good for playing in sand/ waves. Probably won‚Äôt full on swim. Shade would be nice 
- accommodation within walking distance to beach and restaurants that also have a pool. 
- we would all love to see turtles in Ostional if timing works out. Not sure this is possible if staying in samara as I‚Äôve read not to drive there when it‚Äôs dark, yet you have to be there at dusk/dawn to see them. 

This is a one off trip for us. We are prepared to spend money for convenience, good food and comfort within reason.  

Open to suggestions on where specifically to stay. I‚Äôm looking on Airbnb so far.

Costa Rica has become a major cocaine trafficking route for Mexican Cartels,"In the past few years, the Mexican drug cartels have been using Costa Rica as part of cocaine trafficking of cocaine produced by the Colombians.

trip advice: itinerary for late-June,"I have been staying in Costa Rica on a study abroad for the past few months. This country has blown my mind in terms of culture, hospitality, biodiversity, etc. I have spent the majority of my time in Monteverde, but also spent time up and down the Pacific slope. I know it will be a bit rainy in June, but no worries.

I will have two weeks before returning home and want advice! One week is solo, and I have no plans yet. The other week is with my boyfriend. I want to give him the best experience. We both have an intermediate level Spanish.

I have not visited the Caribbean side and was considering doing so during my week solo. Thoughts?

During the week with my partner, I was planning the following -
Monteverde -> Bijagua (Rio Celeste, Volc√°n Tenorio) -> Quepos (Manuel Antonio park) -> Playa Jaco or Playa Hermosa

Generally I am looking for a volcano that is less touristy. A friend recommended Tenorio, but it seems most people only go for Rio Celeste? I think we‚Äôd be interested a good bit of hiking at a volcano or the Tenorio craters. I also have not visited the central coast, hence Manuel Antonio reserve. Would this be a good choice? I have been to Santa Rosa and a few in Monteverde. Overall, I feel like this is a lot in transportation expenses and/or time in a bus. But I can‚Äôt tell; maybe it‚Äôs better to rent a manuel car (?).

One month in Costa Rica - Where to base ourselves?,"My husband and I are in our thirties and we're planning to spend one month somewhere in Costa Rica.

We will be going the entire month of August (which we know is the rainy season).

We're having a hard time picking where to go since we've never gone. We don't want the most touristy place, but we need somewhere with good internet. We're not big into nightlife, but it would be nice to have a few restaurants/bars/cafes (nothing fancy, a fish shack is actually preferred haha). We're beginner surfers, so decent and not-too-big waves in August would be great. Having great nature around is also a must, we'd love to do some hiking and see monkeys and stuff. Last but not least, not sure if important, but we both speak Spanish, so communicating with locals isn't a problem. 

Any recommendations? We were looking at Santa Teresa, which I know is quite popular these days, but less touristy than Tamarindo. I've also been looking at Uvita, Samara and Nosara. Input appreciated.

"5 days in Tamarindo, Costa Rica","We arrived on a Wednesday and stayed 2 days at the Zulu Surf Hotel. Zulu rooms were nice, clean and spacious. The room has a small kitchenette with a microwave and fridge. The property has a purified water machine and offered tea and coffee. The free breakfast from Sol Bakery was top of the list on one of the best places we ate while in Tamarindo. The only thing was missing was a swimming pool. But other than that the hotel was located in the heart of things and convenient. 

    We did an ATV excursion with 506 adventures the ride was slow but the ATV‚Äôs were new and comfortable. We stopped at 2 beautiful beaches along the way. We also did a white water raft excursion with Teriono adventures and the experience was great. 

   We stayed 3 days at the Jardin Eden Boutique hotel adults only and it was peaceful. The rooms comes with robe, slippers, tv, ac , fridge and a balcony with seating. The only missing was a microwave. Jardin offered free breakfast, dinner and one meal at a restaurant off the property. The private beach is a mini hike with a small pool, chairs, bar, and grill all on a patch of grass at the beach. The vibe at both the beach and the pool was very quiet needed some jazz tunes at the pool and Costa Rica party tunes going at the beach. But I would recommend the stay. 

We used tropical tour shuttles for private transportation and it was well worth it. 

Tamarindo isn‚Äôt the party town you would expect. Things seem to die down quick. But if your looking to stay in the heart of what‚Äôs considered a party Zulu surf is the perfect place. 

We dined at Pangas please wear close toe shoe to be prepared for the crabs running around under the table and across your feet. This place could‚Äôve used some soft music to set the mood because personally it had no ambiance. But the food was good.

Moving from USA to CR as a CR citizen (advice needed),"Hi all,
I was born in the US but my parents migrated from CR and most my family is still in CR. I have visited them several times my whole life. I‚Äôm considering moving to CR (I have dual citizenship) as I feel like the US is just going downhill. I‚Äôm too stressed here. Nothing is working out for me, etc. it‚Äôs a really big decision to make though. I have a dog that I would take with me and probably my lizard (bearded dragon). 

I have a masters degree in microbiology and I was laid off in January. I‚Äôm having a really hard time finding a job and I feel like my education and experience is not valued as much as it would be valued in CR. I lived with my family there for 2 months a couple years ago and I was more calm. I have really bad anxiety and the rat race that happens here is probably so bad for my mental and physical health. 

Has anyone made this decision? Whether from US or any other country. What were their steps? Did they have animals they brought? 

Anyone in CR know how well my education and experience would be there? Would I successfully be able to secure a job? 

I‚Äôve been thinking about this for months now. I really want to consider this option before making it. I don‚Äôt want to put my dog and lizard through the move if it‚Äôs just a dumb idea.",costarica

"Recommendations for a US bank to switch to that will have better service (than Wells Fargo) in Costa Rica (San Jose/Alajuela,)","I'm an American who until recently was happy with Wells Fargo. Back in February I was robbed in Medellin Colombia and the thieves got access to my banking login. Wells Fargo locked me out and refused to help me regain access unless I go into a branch with my drivers license (which was also stolen) and passport. I'm actually just thinking about leaving WF and switching to a different bank because they've been unwilling to assist me. My ex wife has also remained on my account and had full access to my money for a while now. They also refused to remove her unless the two of us show up together at a branch...which is impossible because she lives in the midwest and I live in VA.

I currently live in Alajuela and was wondering if anyone could recommend another US based bank that I could get an account with and use, potentially one with a branch or better services internationally, specifically in CR. I'm working on establishing residence there but just can't wait. I need to be able to access my online banking.

Itinerary for 11 days in September/October?,"My boyfriend and I are traveling to Costa Rica for 11 days in late September/early October, flying in and out of San Jose! I know this is rainy season, so trying to figure out what the best itinerary / cities to go to would be. 

We are both in our mid-20s with lots of energy, and want to fill our trip with hiking, seeing beautiful nature, wildlife, seeing the parks and beaches, exploring local towns, and trying great authentic food! 

Here is what we are currently thinking:

Day 1 - Fly into San Jose around 12pm, immediately travel to Monteverde

Day 2 - Monteverde cloud forest hiking / zip lining

Day 3 - travel to La Fortuna

Day 4 - Arenal volcano/La Fortuna waterfall/Hot Springs

Day 5 - travel to Tortuguero

Day 6 - Tortuguero National Park

Day 7 - Travel to Puerto Viejo (or Cahuita or Manzanillo)

Day 8 - Cahuita national park

Day 9 - Pacuare River 2 day hike/paddle trip

Day 10 - Pacuare River 2 day hike/paddle trip, get back to San Jose

Day 11 - 1pm flight out of San Jose


Obviously, we would do more on our travel days then just travel (ideally) but you get the vibe. Should we cut out Monteverde and add a day in each other city? Is our timing okay on any of the cities?

Harrasment won't be tolerated in this subreddit against any local or foreigner,"#Dear visitors

Even our whole community is not even 1% of our country, and it's not all the community that is being a troll, please don't interpret this as our country not being friendly

If you are here as a visitor please be respectful

If you are a local, please be respectful

Let's clear it up, expats are immigrants, but still also expats, a foreigner should introduce themselves to someone from their same country as an expat, and should introduce themselves to someone from a different country as an immigrant. 

Do they do it? That's a different thing and out of our hands and we are not the vocabulary police. 

We are also not the gentrification police, you want things changed? Be vocal with our government, harassing people on reddit doesn't change laws. 

This post is the official announcement and rules will be updated.

Edit to add: the whole mod team here is costarican so stop building strawman arguments.

#Some have taken this message out of context so let's be clear

You **can** still discuss and complain about gentrification, you **cannot** attack someone out of the blue and tell them ""don't come here, f you, stay in your country, we don't want you"" just for asking about living here. 

You **can** call expats immigrants cause they are, you can call them gringos too, you cannot call them sex tourists, drug addicts, or anything else that has no context other than just being from the US or visiting Jaco. 

And we, just as always, will also make sure no one can be abusive towards locals either, we don't publish a log of bans or removals because that's silly but we do remove many because a-hole tourists do exist and have treated locals badly in our sub.

What we are asking is that you don't assume all these things and attack first based on nothing, we don't care what you've heard they treat foreigners in their country like, the user you're talking to has probably not, and the ones who have don't represent a whole country, just like the trolls we have here don't represent our country either.

Disregarding these rules means you can be temporarily or permanently banned, whichever side you're on local or foreign we don't care, just don't be a dick.",costarica

Arenal area La Fortuna tips,"We wrapped up a 3 night trip to La Fortuna on April 1st.
We drove from Manual Antonio (MA) to Arenal and it took us about 5.5 hours with a short stop. If you want to learn some quick tips about MA please look at my other post. https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1276xji/costarica_manuel_antonio_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

Where we stayed:
- We stayed at the Jungle beach lodge:
The place was clean, had a beautiful view, pool, and offered a good free breakfast.
The hotel was a literally a 3 minute walk from the waterfall, it had simple clean rooms and good service. For folks looking for a simple lodging with breakfast I would highly recommend this hotel.
Tip: 
We asked for the 7am breakfast as we preferred to get up early and out the door. They pack up the breakfast to go if requested.

-Arenal Volcano Trek and Mystico hanging bridges:

Planning Tip: 
We coupled the Arenal trek and the Mystico hanging bridges for the same day to save time, and gas. Both of these attractions are close to each other. We finished the Arenal trek, grabbed a quick bite and then did the Mystico hanging bridges. Both of these activities involve quite a bit of walking so this approach may not work for everyone. 

Arenal volcano trek: 
Once you arrive at the park entrance, pay for your tickets. You don‚Äôt need to take a pic of their map from the park office. There is a better updated map at the starting point of the trek.
We have a 8 year old daughter and we did this together. This should give folks an idea about difficulty.
If you want to do sector 4 - Las Coladas (yellow line to old lava flow) or sectors 5 - El Ceibo(red line to the Ceibo tree) proceed to parking lot two. The trek starts from that lot.
The look out at the end of sector 4 is totally worth it. You see the volcano on one‚Äôs side and the lake on the other. It‚Äôs breathtaking.
Tip:
Sector 5 is very muddy. Please wear appropriate shoes and clothing. I would take a light rain jackets just in case, snacks and water. Doing the additional Km‚Äôs on sector 5 was worth it for us. The tree alone is massive, it‚Äôs span, it‚Äôs root system was worth the extra calories we burnt :).
We personally didn‚Äôt use a guide. We used one in Manuel Antonio, how ever we wanted to do this trek at our own pace and needed to be able to increase our speed if needed to complete it faster.
Total trek was Approx 5 Km‚Äôs. 

Mystico Hanging Bridges
We had lunch at the restaurant inside the park. The view from the restaurant was amazing, and the food was excellent including the fresh fruit juices.

The main trail with the bridges takes about 1.5 hours.

Tip: 
This may seem obvious but please use the bathroom before you start the trail. There are no bathrooms until you wrap up the trails.
The longer hanging bridges are high and can shake a lot if there are lots of people on them at the same time (max 15 people). We preferred to wait a bit and get on the bridges when there were less people. The shaking doesn‚Äôt suit everyone and certainly not me who is a bit afraid of heights.

La Fortuna Waterfall 
There is free parking upfront. We found the parking lot not very busy from 8.00-11.00 am. There are Approx 500 steps down and up. Our 8 year old handled this with some breaks in between.

Tip:
Take water shoes, rain coats and or ponchos as it rains often.
Take a rash guard as the water is very cold. Once you get in it‚Äôs so refreshing. 
It‚Äôs about 16 feet deep in the main waterfall area, there is a nice little river area on the side where most people rest up and swim. Lots of fish are there and the kids love it.

Hot Springs
We went to the Titoku hot springs. The reason we chose this spring was due to  less crowds, and as it less touristy. It‚Äôs very small they have about 6 hot springs plus 1 cold spring. When we were there there were two other families.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Titoku for families and on hindsight I feel we should have gone to Baldi which is right next door.
This place is small, there was nothing for the kids to do apart from resting in the hot springs, there were limited sun beds so there was no place for us to launge around unless we wanted to sit on chairs.
The service at the reception and at the bar was great.

Restaurants and Coffee houses:
-El Coloso Arenal Restaurant:
This is a small restaurant focused on local food. They have tons of other options too.
The food was very tasteful, and the prices were excellent.
We tried the small sized Nachos with beef, which were great and enough for 2 people
We tried their seafood fried rice which was sufficient for two adults and their fettuccini chicken pasta.

-Arabigos Coffee House:
Must try for coffee lovers. They‚Äôre known for their Cappuccino and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. 
They have their branded coffee beans for sale for 17,000 Collone‚Äôs a bag. There is a super market right across and this was super helpful for us to grab snacks, fruits, etc.

-Red Frog Coffee House:
This is a cool little place that does a bit of everything. It‚Äôs across from the El Coloso restaurant. They have coffee, meals, souvenirs and cigars etc. They  own the local ice cream joint next door that had excellent ice cream.
Their cappuccino was average however loved the service and the experience.",costarica
CostaRica Manuel Antonio Tips,"This is my 1st post in the community. Reddit helped me so much to plan this trip and I am paying it forward :)
We just wrapped up a 3 night trip ( March 26-29) in MA and we are off to Arenal.

1. The MA national park is a must imo. We used a guide and he was super helpful. They helped us spot so many animals that we wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise. 
Learnings: 
- take your swim clothes as the private beach restricted to the park entrants only is beautiful.
- hat, sunscreen, bug spray, your own water bottles ( no plastic and or food allowed) are must have items. Note: They do a detailed bag check at the entrance and confiscate food and plastic water bottles etc.

2. Manuel Antonio Beach. Overall the beach was beautiful, the ocean was amazing.
- don‚Äôt book surf lessons online or through your hotel. We were quoted some ridiculous prices when I checked prices for a surf lesson for my 8 year old daughter.

- there are various surf schools with little huts on the beach. We used Glen Castro‚Äôs surf school. He is the only company with a Red hut. His service was excellent, price was less than 50% of what was quoted online, and my daughter actually stood up on the surf board and had a memorable experience. I highly recommend him. He also allows his surf boards to be used for the entire day after the lesson.

3. restaurants in this area are very expensive. We tried the bus restaurant  (En Todas). It was a chill experience as it‚Äôs on the beach. The food was decent. Keep an eye on the items you order as they add up pretty quickly. 

- try the Costa Linda bar and restaurant for food and drinks at excellent value. Locals recommended this place to us. We tried the beef fajitas which were great. Beers and cocktails were so much more cheaper than all the other restaurants. They also serve breakfast.
- we had a great experience at El Avion. I know some folks didn‚Äôt have the best experience with the food. It has great views, the airplane inside the restaurant provides that unique touch. We tried the Mahi Mahi dish and the shrimp Rice. Both were good.
- Mila Olas restaurant is a little gem in Quepos. It‚Äôs about a 10 minute drive from
the MA beach. This place had the best meal we had in MA. They have a great local chef who makes some amazing dishes. We tried the Octopus which was next level. The prices were lower than El Avion and the food was amazing.

4. When driving to MA beach the dudes wearing wests are on the road acting like traffic cops. They can be pretty aggressive as they walk to the middle of the road with whistles. Just be careful. I think it‚Äôs ok to pay them to ensure your car is looked after. We didn‚Äôt park on the beach as our hotel was a so close to the beach.",costarica

Solving Real Estate Problems in Costa Rica,"A distant relative inherited a few lots in Costa Rica that they now want to sell. They're empty lots (no buildings), but a squatter has begun to build on at least one of them. There may be issues with water rights. At least one of them needs to have the deed redone because the boundary of the lot is incorrect. They have a broker, but would like things to move along faster. I'm good at taking care of these kinds of things in the United States, but I have never been to Costa Rica and my Spanish is beginner level.

Most laidback towns,"Ever since traveling to Costa Rica years ago, it always stuck with me as a place to live and maybe settle. I know taking a trip is far different from day-to-day living.

How is Costa Rica able to protect SO MUCH of its natural land?,"I recently took a vacation with my American family to Costa Rica, and the thing that struck me was how WILD and NATURAL Costa Rica seemed. How can a country as rich as Costa Rica resist paving over the whole thing and building lots of malls and amusement parks and towns the way it is the US? Is Costa Rica just still in the process of building and developing, or have they actually managed to choose consciously to keep the country so natural?

I'm **\*CURRENTLY WRITING AN ESSAY\*** on this exact question for my college class, and despite a bunch of research I still feel like there's something I'm not getting. So, I thought I might ask for your guys' help. Here are the hypotheses I have so far:

‚Ä¢ The 1948 revolution and subsequent demilitarization created a peace-loving self-identity among Costa Ricans, and that this was why they were so willing to embrace environmentalism in the 1980s. They just choose to keep so much of the country forested because of their self-identity as environmental stewards.

‚Ä¢ Costa Rica's nature is able to stay unspoiled because it can be monetized through ecotourism (although tourism only accounts for 9% of Costa Rica's GDP).

‚Ä¢ Other countries, as well as multi-national corporations trying to be green, basically pay Costa Rica to preserve its nature because of the global benefits of its biodiversity and ability to capture carbon to fight climate change.

‚Ä¢ Costa Rica got a slow start after colonization and they are still in the process of replacing a lot of nature with man-made structures (no evidence yet, just a guess).

‚Ä¢ Costa Rica's topography and mountains prevent development of a lot of places (not evidence yet, just a guess).

‚Ä¢ I'm just not used to being outside of the US and a lot of places in Latin America feel way more natural, jungly, and unspoiled like Costa Rica does (conjecture).

I really appreciate any thoughts or corrections that you might have about anything I've said. Thanks!",costarica

Advice for 11 days in Costa Rica in September,"Coming to Costa Rica from Canada.  We will arrive late on Sept 1 in San Jose and fly home early on Sept 13.  So 11 full days to enjoy all CR has to offer.  

I know it's particularly rainy in September.  So my first question is should we avoid it and come back when we can time the weather a bit better?   I assume the answer to that is no, but if it's torrential downpour every day then we might rethink the entire trip. 

If not, we want to split our time between rainforest/mountain interior and beachy/tropical coastline.  We primarily enjoy walking in nature, snorkeling (my partner also dives), beaches, food, and especially wildlife.  I've heard wildlife sanctuaries are in a league of their own in CR, so we probably want to do one or two of those.  We'd probably want to do some cool hikes in the interior as well.  

I'm pretty set on Monteverde and La Fortuna for our ""interior"" destinations.  My main question is where to pick for coastal destinations.  I'm between the northwest Pacific peninsula (Tamarindo, Santa Maria), or the southern Caribbean coast (Puerto Viejo, Manzanillo) - opposite ends of the country.  Which is better in terms of weather during early September?  

We plan on renting a car as well.  Is that a safe bet?  We really value being in each place for longer than 2 days so I think 3 overnight destinations is our max, but a car would allow us to see the country and make stops in between destinations.  

Or if anyone has any recommendations for itineraries I'm not thinking of, it would be greatly appreciated!

If you only had 4 days ‚Äî,"Hey yall! If you are willing to read this and help out, I can‚Äôt thank you enough!

So my partner and I are traveling to Papagayo in 4 weeks for a wedding. I have very little job flexibility, and, unfortunately, don‚Äôt learn whether my PTO is approved until the schedule for that time is published. After months of crossing our fingers, almighty boss man has approved my request, and I‚Äôve got an extra five days to spend in CR!

At this point I have researched my head off and am utterly overwhelmed by how much there is to do and see in CR. Partner and I both absolutely love wildlife, particularly birds, but we are going to be 100% worn out from the first half of the trip and very ready to relax.

Hopefully this is just our first trip to Costa Rica and, next time, we can jam-pack our itinerary with multiple stops. But for this particular stretch of days, I‚Äôm looking for a balance of creature comforts, downtime at the pool/beach, and as much wildlife exposure as possible without a daylong trek into the forest. 

I have found a few resort properties that look great but, before I book, I was wondering if anyone here would be open to sharing any lived-experience suggestions.

A TL;DR re: what I‚Äôm looking for ‚Äî

1. Distance from Papagayo is the least of my concerns. If there‚Äôs something amazing nearby, the proximity is obviously a bonus, but I am used to driving in high-risk, unfamiliar environments and am undeterred by a road trip. On the other hand, I freak out on tiny planes but will board one if warranted. I care more about the destination than the journey this time around. 

2. Nice to luxe-ish resort ($500 USD per night max) that is either beachfront or beach-adjacent. Willing to go a little pricier if the beach is true paradise, or it the property is especially serene and/or wellness-oriented

3. Plentiful birdwatching opportunities along with some monkeys, iguanas, and, if we‚Äôre lucky, a sloth nearby

I'm (mid 30M) coming to CR for 2 weeks May10-24. I'm going to be visiting some friends for a portion of the trip, and they are on the west coast. I am planning on renting a car, but don't have much planned other than seeing them in Samara.

1. Good surfing and schools (beginner)
2. Relaxing/Chill 
3. Option to meet some women. No professionals. Actual women.

I know Samara is a nice place that I could stay for a while, but figured I should try some other places. 

I hear Santa Teresa is good, Jaco is also good, but lots of Pros. The other thing that I would like to do is stay somewhere in the interior a bit, but less time there than on the coast. If anyone has recommendations on where to go, how long to stay there, what to do, etc. that would be really helpful.

I love this beautiful country ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I've been here several times over the last 20 years. The first time I came as a young 20 something, looking for adventure and met my first husband who was working at a beach side bar in Playa Hermosa near Jaco. I stayed with him in Jaco for maybe 8 months then we moved to El Salvador where he was from originally for another few months before getting married and moving back to the US.
I've since been back many times, even though we are no longer together. 
This trip was just me and my two oldest, my children from that first marriage. They are 15 and 16 now and we came just the three of us for this spring break. It's been such a special trip. Their bio dad is not part of their lives (since they were very little) but it's been fun to remember and share some of the good memories I had with him. Mostly to see them connect with their Latino heritage a bit.

We started our trip in Jaco for a few days, did an amazing horseback riding adventure up in the mountains complete with a volcanic mud bath and dip in a jungle river.
Next on to beautiful Manuel Antonio where we did an incredible Zipline tour and then a guided tour of the national park where we saw three different kinds of monkeys, two sloths, tucans, bats, lizards. Such a beautiful area. I would plan more time there next time!
Then on to Uvita for our last few days. We walked along the beach to explore the famous whale tale.
We also did a snorkeling trip to Ca√±o Island. Swam with sea turtles and schools of hundreds of beautiful fish. Incredible. Highly recommend!!
Today is our last day in Uvita and we're tired, sunburnt and just relaxing. Tomorrow we head back to San Jose for our last night in this beautiful country and fly home early Monday. 
This itinerary has worked out wonderfully and I would recommend it to anyone looking to experience a few different beach towns.

What do you wish you had brought with you to Costa Rica?,"This summer I‚Äôll be moving to the central valley for at least two years.

Aside from clothes, shoes, toiletries and beauty products, what do you rank in the order of best items to bring? 


For example, I love cooking and have a range of (smallish) electrical kitchen appliances. Would it be best to sell and buy again in country or bring with me? 


I‚Äôm currently in Asia where electronics, housewares and pretty much everything apart from some foreign (western) brands is very affordable. I‚Äôm trying to compile a list of things to buy/bring over but I have to be quite selective as there‚Äôs limited space.

Tips to drive in Costa Rica and some anecdotes,"Driving in Costa Rica is scary for many newcomers. It is the 4th worst place in the world to drive. So fears aside, what are some tips to understand the life of a driver there?  It is a long post, but I guarantee you that it will be entertaining as not only there are tips but also anecdotes.

Costa Rica was a place with farms in 19th century and roads were built around these farms to make horses and carts and from there it evolved to a city, which means that going around the block in many areas takes a long time. Farms were built so you see lots of streets getting into the farm that are dead ends.

**Why infrastructure is in such poor condition**

In 1948 a dynasty of politicians, 2 parties composed by the elite started to alternate themselves in power. So money started to go to their pockets instead of becoming infrastructure.  So they build roads and then they fix pipes and break it.  Or they intentionally plan to build some sections poorly so pot holes appear and there is company revenue in road maintenance reparis. There are many ongloing corruption cases where the elites are using all their power to evade justice in very unethical ways or use media to distract attention from the most important cases. So the final result is decades of poor urban planning, and good roads where you suddenly have a pot hole that will break your car, or unfinished works that could endanger you, or just roads without maintenance for years which had to be fixed by local population.

There is a curious anecdote from more than 20 years ago. The factory of jelly products, El Angel was formed by South American expats who did care about making a difference in the community. The road to Sarapiqui was in poor condition, so they offered municipality to pay half the price of a road.  They needed that road to bring products out to the city.  The project cranked up and the company started to pour a few milimeters of asphalt instead of the 6 cm thick layer it should have.  The El Angel engineer noticed that and demanded to meet the correct specs. The company tried to dismiss him, but then he said that if that was the case, only the municipality would pay half the price, since their donation would not take place.  So they were literally FORCED to build meeting minimal engineering specs.

This is why Costa Rica infrastructure does not look like South Korea.  It has been decades of a corrupt oligopoly having control of infrastricture projects. And the toxic corrupt environment has not been fixed in this environment. If you want a stressful life, go to work there at MOPT.  Politics is still corrupt no matter which party rules.

End result, infrastructure is like driving in the videogame Motorstorm apocalypse with utility poles in the street, Sinkholes in the street and surprises here and there, and other surprises. Did I mention it is the 4th worst place in the world to drive.

With a vehicle fleet growing 7% per year and streets not growing, it became cluttered and traffic jams are terrible.  So do not drive if you do not need to. Or enjoy the life of spending hours in a traffic jam. This is especially true if you need to go to the airport to go back home.

Try to train yourself using Motorstorm Apocalypse for Playstation. It is a great game to deal with infrastructure susprises like the ones you will find in Costa Rica.

For example...

* If you drive going down from Tres Rios via calle vieja downhill, 3 lanes become 2 and there is a concrete fence of a house at the end and no sign and no bright colors to warn you.  Locals know it and avoid it.  They drive fast because they know the road, you do not.
* If you drive from Casa Matute to the east, you will see some beautiful old trees inside the road in the right side so you better move left to avoid them.
* If you come from San Pedro and you go to Curridabat, 2 lanes become 1 at a bridge in a curve, and you could crash against a tall concrete sidewalk at night as it is poorly illuminated.
* If you drive from Intel to the highway, there is a big sinkhole in the middle of a nice road that would make the nose of the car hit the asphalt if the car bottom is not too high above the road and you drive as fast as the road and speed limit allows.
* Speed reductors are so tall sometimes that they may hit the bottom of your car.
* In the expensive neighborhood north of La Galera, there is a utility pole in the middle of a clean neat street of a neighborhood of rich people.
* I once met a man who drove in the countryside. There was a narrow concrete bride without fence near a tight dirt curve, so his car did skid, and when he entered the bridge he went to the river, tipped over and his wife died.  He woke up in the hospital after 6 months.

And so many other surprises.  General rule of thumb drive slow, let your visibility determine the speed so you are able to brake if something weird appears.

**A decadent justice system**

Since the 1980s the trend of setting criminal offenders free after the arrest made crime to go unpunished.  Kids started to learn that stealing has no consequence and dishonesty started to htrive, so if you leave your stiuff unattended in a mall in the city, it is likely that you get your stuff stolen, not by criminals, but ordinary people. It is not that all people are dishonest but enough people are.

In march 2023 US government issued a crime alert for Costa Rica

>[EEUU emite alerta de seguridad por aumento de crimen en Costa Rica](https://www.crhoy.com/nacionales/eeuu-emite-alerta-de-seguridad-por-aumento-del-crimen-en-costa-rica/)

Criminals are sexist and xenophobic, and I am not using political definitions. They literally target women because they think women are weak, and they target foreigners because they think foreigners are rich.  They do not feel that stealing is bad and they believe in using the force and they are entitled and vengeful.

Human rights NGOs here defend the rights of criminals, but not the rights of tourists and honest locals.

Close your windows, do not leave objects inside your car when you are not in it. And learn about where crime is more present. For example, Quepos and Manuel Antonio are known for having surf and tourists, but not too many people will tell you it got filled with crime there too.

**Motorcycles everywhere and other demons**

In a cluttered city where traffic jams turned streets into parking lots, people started to buy motorcycles and developed the habit of invading opposite lanes or use lines between lanes as a mototcycle lane.

So you will see bikers passing you in the left and in the right, and if you switch lanes, not only you must watch for other cars, but look motorcycles coming behind.  They will get upset if you ""invade their lane"" as they feel entitled and they may start a fist fight or damage your vehicle if they get upset. Many of these bikers do not have license, and the police parking lots are fuilled with motorcycles for this reason, and many of them come from slums or poor neighborhoods where issues are solved with fist fights.

With cars it depends on where you drive. For example, Desamaparados canton has a culture of such fist fighting and bullying your way in the street. So if you drive in a place with such subculture, you may expect drivers to have that subculture.  And these people do not stay always inside the canton, so you may find them elsewhere, just a matter of luck.

If you see people doing bad maneuvers that should even look like going against the law, stay calm and stay away, let them pass. You do not want to have a bad day or spend your day in a fight with some uncivilized trash people.

What makes them trash? The subculture of crime polluted people. Also a cluttered street and long hours of jams stress people. So more than just evil, what you have is a lack of mental health in the street, to a point where people may get violent in the cities.

So you need full awareness as if you were in a combat zone. Look front sides and rear and always know where all vehicles are around you. If they get in your way or they do dangerous things that would earn them a Darwin award, stay away from them and let them pass, because you do not want to deal with a crash or insurance paperwork, because that is not what you came to do.

Driving is a necessary annoyance to go to point B from point A. So, survive and once you are at point B, enjoy your trip.

If you planned to ride a motorcycle, do not. Life is not safe there if you ride one. Many drivers are aggressive and will not respect you.

Drivers do terrible driving, but most believe they are better drivers than everyone else. You even notice how bad they are when they drive a small car and they have problems to park in a spot designed for a big car.

**Driving in slippery roads**

When it starts to rain, even if it is a light rain, water will go under oil drops, so street becomes as slippery as it would with a heavy rain, even if it looks dry. So drive half the speed you would drive normally. This would save your life.

Unless you need to drive in rough terrain with a 4x4, rent a sedan because lower cars are more stable.  It is easier to tip over a big car than a sedan. It happens in 2 ways. During collisions, big cars tend to tip over, and in case of evading maneuvers, big cars tip over more easily to the sides.  Remember, it is Costa Rica, full of curves, not a flat desert in USA.

Check the tires because you will need to have the best grip.

If you drive above 40kph, your only option is to hit the brakes if needed.  Evading may get you killed, especially in these streets.

**Increasing your chances of survival**

There are 3 things that cause 70% of deaths in Costa Rican streets:

* **Not obeying traffic signs**. Not obeting traffic lights or a stop sign cause lots of crashes. So obey traffic signs yourself and use the claxon to warn others as you get close to an intersection and do not drive too fast.
* **Invading opposite lane.** Head on collisions are one of the main causes of death. Going off road will usually be better than a head on collision. When I learned to drive I learned the priorities to evade. Cliffs, pedestrians, other vehicles, and pot holes at last. Memorize this hierarchy and you will be able to save yourself from a lot of trouble. I use to drive behind a truck that drives at the speed I want to drive, so any invading vehicle would crash against the truck and not me.
* **Speeding**.  Crashing at 40hoh is like falling from a second floor, you get hurt but you may survive.  Crashing at 60kph is like falling from 6 floors, you can only use breaks and keep driving in the same direction because streets are narrow to evade anything. Crashing at 90kph is like falling from 13th floor, not survivable. Crashing at 120kph is like falling from 22 floors.

There are some miracle cases like the case of a motorcycle driver near the airport who saw a traffick light going yellow and he accelerated. But red reached him and a car came out, so he crashed at 120kph and he spent years learning to walk.

If you do not engage in any of these 3 behaviors and you protect yourself against those who do, then you increase your survival chances.

**Health insurance**

There is a government institution called CCSS that provides public healthcare. For foreigners who plan to stay longer, getting a ""seguro voluntario"" (voluntary insurance) is a good option. basically you declare yourself as a freelancer with an estimated income, which is used to calculate the monthly fee.

May be for things like a surgery or chronic or rare disease it may take forever, but for most common health problems it is a great option. What common problems? You got diarrhea because you ate a bad food, you had an accident at home and got hurt, etc.

It will save lots of money. You do not need to worry about bills and most common medicines are covered.

The only catch is that seguro voluntario is voluntary to join, but to get out you need to prove them that you got hired by a company in Costa Rica, which will pay your insurance from that point on.  Still, even if you need to pay it forever, it is always a great option to have a very affordable healthcare service. This monthly fee is the only price to use the service, so you do not care about money when you are sick.

This is especially useful if you send your kid to take college in Costa Rica using public school system that is free. No debt. Just tell your kid to not consume substances because I mentioned that criminals are xenophobic, so your kid will need to stay away from these troublemakers that will try to take advantage of foreigners. And CCSS healthcare is a great way to protect your kid. So free college and cheap healthcare will save your kid from debt and health problems.  Check how to make college in Costa Rica valid in your country.

I hope you stay healthy, but if you have issues, CCSS insurance is a nice option for non complex health issues.  If you plan to live in Costa Rica, I really advise to get health from CCSS at least as a backup plan, and if you want to use private medicine, that is up to you.

**Epilogue**

I have tried to be honest about Costa Rica. I could have sugar coated itand appeal to the trope of Costa Rica Pura Vida and Essential Costa Rica, but I preferred to tell you how things are.   Most of people in all nations are usually good people, but there are situations that may not be that nice.

I feel that between the deterioration of making a living conditions, traffic jams, protection towards criminals, and lack of mental health, Costa Rica is getting less pura vida for locals.  And that impacts tourists too.

Still Costa Rica is not the worst place in the world. It has supervised banks where balances are monitored more transparently than in other developed countries, so regulators know exactly what happen with banks and are able to tackle financial crisis more effectively.  Everything is close, so you do not have to drive miles to buy something.  And food is fresh. It is not like going to a big country and eat a sandwich with vegetables that remained one week in a fridge after a long trip in a truck.  So it also is harder to have empty shelves, and if they eventually, buying elsewhere is easy as distances are not too long.

Living in ""condominio"" (groups of apartment buildings or houses with or without parking and other amenities and a fence around) is better as they have security guard. Houses do not.

Having a car is a must unless there is a good bus service near you to connect you to places of interest.  That is very rare to find. So a car is needed.  It is better to buy a ""seminuevo"" car from car agency (new cars are not worth it) and save money to avoid debt.  Used cars are a hassle in Costa Rica as they try to sell you garbage, and via internet you may get scammed in Costa Rica. And finding a reliable mechanic is like finding a honest politician.  So consider finding a reliable mechanic as part of the car purchase.

Obviously you will need a parking lot, so consider that when renting a place.  Learn with locals which are places where criminals live (almost everyone knows that), and find a place away from these places.

And make sure you have the best tires with the best grip. In Costa Rican street grip of good tires is one of the best cost effective tools to protect yourself from an accident.

The best way to live is to be a contrarian. Instead of going where everyone goes, do the opposite, like taking a trip during low season. That way a hotel and swimming pool and restaurant will be almost just for you. And as you are not with the crowd, you will also not be in the traffic jam with other people. And by doing so you are helping a business to survive as you are a customer that helps them to have some revenue in low season.  So plan trips in non holidays.

If you want to get the best prices for groceries, Costa Rica government has an app [here](https://www.mimejorcompracr.go.cr/).  You indicate a location and product and it will tell you which are the best places to buy.  That will make your life more affordable now that USD is going down.",costarica

CR in June: looking for help with itinerary and other things,"Hello! I've wanted to visit Costa Rica for a long time and now I'm finally going in June. I'll be there for almost three weeks and I don't know much yet, so I hope you can  help me plan my trip.

The \[very loose\]  plan so far is to rent a car and travel to some different spots for the first week or two, then do Workaway (working in exchange for food and accommodation) somewhere nice.

In general, I don't want to spend a ton of money on accommodation and food, and I'd prefer to avoid places that are too overcrowded by tourists. But I'm sure there are some absolute must-sees and must-dos; just finding a good balance between that and a more unique/authentic experience would be cool.

Some questions:

1. Places to visit?
2. Car/terrain: I've heard roads in CR can be pretty unwelcoming, so what kind of car do you recommend that I rent? 4x4 drive? Specific rental companies you recommend?
3. How do I know where I'm allowed to camp in CR?
4. Any options for meeting natives living in more traditional ways, maybe staying with them for a few days?
5. Considering what I've written above, for how long would you recommend I travel around before settling down to do Workaway?
6. What are some traditional Costa Rican dishes?
7. Spanish phrases/words specific to Costa Rica?
8. My Spanish has gotten rusty so I think it could help to start watching some movies in Spanish, and they might as well be from Costa Rica. Any good movies to recommend?
9. Internet/data SIM card for my phone?",costarica

We are about to lose a very important element of our country's gastronomy and culture.,"This is what's at stake if the Big Cooperative Dos Pinos and Sigma have their way and manage to take away the designation of origin for Queso Turrialba in Costa Rica.

Not only would we ticos lose a part of our identity and tradition, but the small producers would find it even harder to connect with the general consumer and show the quality of their products. (If you didn't know about Queso Turrialba's designation of origin, you can read more about it [here](http://bit.ly/40pEMOA) )


Even though Dos Pinos and Sigma have already tried twice to get rid of this distinction and lost both times, they continue to use their vast economic resources to make it happen. They are currently on their third try. (You can read more about the lawsuit  [here](https://bit.ly/3JBRd34) )

This lawsuit is underway, and after an audience scheduled for this week, where small producers are presenting their case, there are only 20 days before a veredict is reached.
So, what can be done to protect our culture and help the small producers?


Learn more about these big corporations and their efforts to strip Costa Rica out of the designation of origin for Queso Turrialba.

Share this information with your friends, family and contacts on Social Media.

Let's go viral with this information to create pressure on Dos Pinos and Sigma. Let's show them that the consumers reject their obscene attempts to strip our country of it's identity just for profit and bulldoze the small producers out of the economic stage.

It's critical that we share this information now and generate as much noise as possible, to create awareness.

If we all fight together, we can help the small producers from being striped down of what little advantage they have to compete against these Giants like Dos Pinos and Sigma.
Let's share this and continue to enjoy the real Queso Turrialba and help keep our traditions for future costarrican generations. 

Let us fight to protect Costarrican culture and Costarrican gastronomy!

Since it seems like I may not be able to go through an agency‚Äîwhat sort of things will I need to know as a first time renter in Costa Rica? Are there things I should know to ask?

Is there a standard rental term expectation (e.g., 1 year as in the US?) or are the owners more flexible? More rigid? I also have pets‚Äîis it normal to have a pet deposit as it is in the US?

Are there any especially worrisome things I should look out for?

- Passing by a few signs that had property for sale, it sort of had me tempted haha. However, after listening to some of the awesome staff at Hacienda and some vendors I met on the way, figured it wasn‚Äôt the most respectful thing to do.

- I WILL be visiting again, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be moving in anytime soon after seeing the devastation negligent foreign investments have caused.

2 weeks in November/December,"My family (wife and 3 year old) and I have booked a 2 week trip to Costa Rica, our first visit! We'll be there Nov. 20th to Dec. 6th.

We have a rough idea of what we'd like to do, but given that we've never been I wanted to double check with the experts that what we'd like to do is realistic, both in general, and with a 3 year old in tow.

Our general itinerary is to fly into San Jos√© and spend the first week of our trip in the Monteverde area. Our family loves to hike and loves wildlife. I'm a semi-professional photographer so I'm especially excited about this area. 

Our second week we're  planning on gong to the beach and the Caribbean coast seems very appealing, given its more low-key nature than most places on the Pacific. Access to calm  beaches and short jungle walks is what we're after. We don't like crowds and we're not visiting for the surf.

My only concern about the above itinerary is that Monteverde and the Caribbean coast being in opposite directions of San Jos√©, so there will be a lot of back tracking, but I do feel that we have the time. 

A few questions: 
1) Is public transportation to and from those areas a good and reliable option? 

2) Is there anywhere between Cahuita and Monteverde that would be a nice stop to break up a long travel day?

3) Is there a Pacific beach area that would offer similar low-key vibes that the Caribbean offers?

Micromill Coffee Tours in Costa Rica?,"I'll be taking a trip soon to Costa Rica and one of the main reasons is to visit specialty coffee origins.

Mixed Messages about Driving,"*we have 3 full days to plan out. Flying into San Jose late Wednesday and leaving Sunday at 4pm*

I‚Äôm trying to make some key decisions but are getting tons of mixed messages.

Such as: 
Manuel Antonio is amazing vs. Only go to Manuel Antonio for ‚Äúhookers and bad blow‚Äù (which I actually don‚Äôt even really know what is meant by it, but sounds bad)

Driving in Costa Rica is gorgeous vs. I‚Äôm going to spend my whole trip in the car because roads are treacherous to where I want to go and traffic is horrendous and I can only drive during the day

so yes‚Ä¶I do understand people have different opinions but wow, such extremes. It leads me to back to square one 

Of trying to decide -

To drive or not drive 

To stay in San Jose the whole time and use it as base camp or drive somewhere else like La Fortuna 


Ideally, we would stay the night in San Jose, drive early in the morning to a place that is easy to drive to (even if it will take hours, it‚Äôs ok, but a plus if it has stops we can do) 
Ideally, this would be our base camp and from there either drive or take tours to

"If you are interested in acquiring local products and at the same time helping out the regional economy and the producers of the town of Turrialba, this is a great initiative.","It's no secret that the costarrican groceries market is ruled by big corp (Walmart I'm looking at you), and whenever you buy products like cheese or coffee, is hard to know who exactly made them and how much are they getting back from the profit of the sale.

With this in mind, a close friend is developing this great initiative to help close the gap between small local producers of the town of Turrialba and the general consumers. It's called [Turri.cr](https://bit.ly/comprar_local_de_turri)

 The general idea is to try and make local products more accesible and at the same time, shine the spotlight a little brighter on the producers, so that the consumer can get to know the people making the stuff they want to buy, learn about their effort and hopefully, help them keep their traditions so that their legacy can live on. This will eventually help shift the scales in favour of the original producers, and help them get the bigger piece of the pie, as they should. 

So if you have a little time to check it out, I encourage you to do so. 
The project is just getting off the ground, so the lineup of products is modest in quantity, but rich and bountiful in quality. I hope you get to experience that for yourselfs. At the moment, delivery is available for folks in the great metropolitan area only, but they plan to expand the area of service eventually. 

Have a great day!",costarica

Thank you for an incredible 3 weeks! Trip report + photos,"Last month, I visited CR for the first time and had an incredible time. Thank you to the Ticos and Ticas I met that helped us out along our journey, never once did I feel like I was in danger or someone was trying to scam us. CR is such a beautiful country with a way of life the rest of the world can learn from. Although, it's pretty easy to live Pura Vida when you live by some of the nicest beaches in the world. 

In week 1, I stayed in the remote mountain town of Santa Maria de Dota, they just so happened to have their annual fair on the day we arrived so it was a great experience of authentic Costa Rican food,  music and culture. It's a nice town for great coffee and good restaurants, but a bit sleepy with little to no nightlife. We probably should've done a couple days instead of a whole week- but it was interesting to be immersed in a virtually tourist-free area. 

Week 2, we went to Uvita, a beautiful small beach town with a national park that has a beach with two shores! Definitely pretty touristy and not cheap, but some local-owned options are around. Our whale tour with Dolphin Tours was awesome- Fernando knew so much and was a passionate speaker, we almost didn't go because of the price but I guarantee it's worth every penny. Playa Uvita was my favourite beach and the most serene part of my trip, golden hour here was jaw-dropping. 

Week 3, I stayed at Selina in Manuel Antonio and had such a fun time. The beaches in the national park are great, and the sunsets were some of the best I've ever seen. I liked the sodas to choose from just outside the National Park, good authentic costa rican food for a decent price. Staying at the Selina was great as I was working some days so I used their co-working office on the rooftop. 

I had 3 very different experiences over 3 weeks, and still have so much to see in the country, I will 100% be coming back for another trip to see the North and Caribbean side. But all in all, I'm happy with how the trip played out, I learned Spanish, I had great food, met so many people from all different walks of life and took some of the best pictures I've ever taken. Check out some of the highlights:

Rental home broken into in Costa Rica,"Traveling in Costa Rica the past two weeks. Met up with my group of friends on Monday and have been in the house we rented near Uvita all well. Last night while away, our home and three separately attached bedrooms were broken into and valuables stolen. Money, a few passports, headphones were taken. Obviously it was not smart to leave any money/passports home and that is recognized by those in the group whose things were taken. (Just stating that because that‚Äôs clearly the first mistake up on our parts) 

We are renting through a property company. They sent maintenance to fix the broken doors which took about five minutes. They said they would review security footage. The alarm did not go off. They said this has never happened at this property. 

The rental company is supposed to come to the house in the next few hours to discuss and advise.  

My friends whose passport were stolen are going to make a police report for the embassy. 

What other steps can we do in this situation? Is there any other information to ask from the rental company? Clearly traveling comes with this risk and theft is common in CR especially this situation but want to be as proactive as I can.

I have been reading old texts from la revista de costa rica and other explorers a long with more modern takes on this matter and would love some input if possible, or a suggestion for what to look for.My paper focuses on the following volcanoes: Irazu, Poas, Rincon de la vieja, Arenal and Turrialba. Although this is partly a linguistic question, I feel it is also largely a historical matter.There are three historical names that I cant seem to find any info on for 

Volcan Arenal:

* **Pan de Azucar (This one seems to refer to the shape of the volcano and seems to be a common term for volcanoes in central/south america but I cant seem to find any indication as to why it began being referred to as such),**
* **Volcan Pelon,**
* **Volcan de los ahogados (which may refer to a supposed sacrifice which occured long ago), and**
* **Canaste.**

These last few I have been able to find very little information on.I would also appreciate any other tips on researchers and literature on this, I have mainly been referencing **Alvarado Induni Guillermo's** work, along with **Gerardo J. Soto,** and lastly **Constanza Ceruti,** amongst many histotrical documents. Thank you again!",costarica

8 Days in CR - Thoughts on itinerary?,"I will be on my first visit to Costa Rica in March. I want to maximize seeing as much as we can. My thought is rather than making long day trips, we move hotels as we travel so we aren't spending huge amounts of time going back and forth to sights.

The plan is to travel from Liberia airport to Nueva Arenal for two nights where we can make a day trip to Arenal springs/volcano.

Then travelling east, we can break up our trip with some adventure stuff (zipline?) on the way to Playa Flamingo for a 3 night stay. We plan to visit Poza los Coyotes one day and do some relaxing on the beach.

Then we move further south to Tamarindo for 3 nights to explore some of the beaches in that area and the downtown.

I know this is an abbreviated trip to visit 3 areas. Do you think this is a feasible/enjoyable plan? Anything else we should see en route? We are traveling with a 5-year old, so family-friendly is important.",costarica
Costa Rican language,"What's up, guys? I've just started learning Spanish (and it's extremely fascinating) and soon enough I figured out that Latin American Spanish and Castilian Spanish are somewhat different - probably like British and American English. Yet, citizens of Spain and a Latin American country would still communicate easily and understand each other perfectly, which is also amazing. I had a couple of questions concerning the peculiarities of Costa Rican language, specifically:  
a) Is it true that Costa Ricans don't use ""Tu"" to address ""You"" and would rather use ""Usted"" or ""Vos""? If so, then what's the difference between usted and vos?  
b) How do Costa Ricans pronounce words starting with V - for instance Vamos? Will it sound more like Vamos or Bamos?   
c) What about C+E combinations? For instance ""Encantado de conocerte"". Does the latter sound like conoSerte? Or more like conoTHerte?   
d) If I fail at learning Spanish (which I hope won't happen, but still) would Costa Ricans be happy to speak English?",costarica

"10 Day Trip (Puerto Viejo, La Fortuna, Tamarindo)","Hi everyone - apologies for the lengthy post, I tend to ramble. My boyfriend, his friend and I will be visiting Costa Rica mid March for 10 days.  Additional background: I visited CR in 2018 and did a very quick (but amazing and action packed) trip to La Fortuna for 2 nights and then flew Sansa and did 3 nights in Manuel Antonio.  My boyfriend visited in 2017 and had a quick stay in Puerto Viejo for 4 days. This trip I‚Äôm open to anything but would like to visit friends in Tamarindo if possible and boyfriend wants to return to Puerto Viejo for sure. Our friend who is joining doesn‚Äôt have any preference.  Does my proposed itinerary seem too hectic? Open to all/any suggestions, thank you! 

We arrive kind of late (9pm) in San Jose so we figured we‚Äôd stay the night there on day of arrival 3/7. Then next morning we head to Puerto Viejo for 3 nights (don‚Äôt have transportation worked out yet) (3/8-3/11). We have a rental Airbnb in Playa Cocles which comes with bikes so not sure if we should even bother renting a car? After checkout on 3/11 we wanted to do rafting at Pacuare River and they will pick us up in Puerto Viejo and we have the option to be dropped off either in San Jose or La Fortuna.  I was thinking La Fortuna. I assume after rafting that the drop off would be later in the evening. So I‚Äôm thinking to stay another day/night in La Fortuna 3/11-3/13. Now from La Fortuna leaving 3/13 morning, would it be trying to do too much to rent a car and drive to Tamarindo, possibly around the Nicoya Peninsula, Montezuma, and then ferry back to Puntarenas and return to San Jose? 

We fly home 12:30am on 3/18 so we have to be back in San Jose airport later 3/17 evening. We basically have 5 days to go from La Fortuna to Tamarindo (my friends own the Grateful Hotel) then either stay 1-2 nights there and continue on. Maybe one night in Nosara/Samara and then a night in Montezuma. Then take our time getting back to San Jose from Montezuma?  Too much driving? I‚Äôm open to suggestions!",costarica

Paquera or Jaco or Tamarindo?,"I'm planning a trip for the end of June with my husband and 2 kids.  We'll be flying into San Jose and then heading over to La Fortuna/Arenal.

I'm second guessing myself and wondering if Jaco/Manuel Antonio or Tamarindo would be better?  Any issues with the roads in Paquera in June?

Quepos to Liberia,"I've made a mistake and hoping you all can help reassure me.

My wife and I will be visiting this summer.  We booked flights arriving in SJO and departing LIR a week later.  The idea being that we would spend a day or two in San Jose and then spend the rest of the trip in Guanacaste region, hence the departure from LIR.  Instead, we have now decided we want to stay in the Quepos/Manuel Antonio area, so I think it would be better to fly out of SJO.  However, the site where we booked our flights is not allowing me to change my departure city, so we may be stuck flying out of LIR anyway.

&#x200B;

So, what is the easiest way to get from Quepos to Liberia?  I don't see any direct flights through Sansa, and not sure we want to fly into SJO and change planes to LIR.  But it also looks like a pretty long and expensive drive if we were to get a shuttle the entire way.  I also thought of maybe splitting it up and getting a shuttle to Monteverde or somewhere along the way, and then get a shuttle from there to LIB the next day.  Any suggestions?

Mud baths, bioluminescent beaches, canyoning, night nature walk, caves, volcanoes, snorkeling, kayaking interest me. I love coffee and dark chocolate.

Osa peninsula with 4.5 year old? (cross-posted to r/costaricatravel),"(I posted this to r/costaricatravel as well, not sure what the best place is for advice)

TLDR: Is it stupid to go to the Osa Peninsula with a 4.5 year old who can ""only"" hike 3-4 miles? If so, where should we go instead? If not, what should we do in the Osa and is it a good idea to stay by the beach?

Looking for advice and suggestions from people who know the Osa Peninsula. We are just starting to plan our trip for next February, when our son will be 4.5 years old. We are most interested in seeing wildlife, and our secondary interest is beach time. I've read amazing things about Corcovado NP, but it seems like the hikes are very intense and the journey just to enter the park can be long. My kid is adventurous and has boundless energy, but he'll be under 5 years and and it just doesn't seem like going into the park would be the best plan for our family (please let me know if I'm wrong here!).

If we are looking at the Osa Peninsula area, what would be our best bet for experiencing wildlife and the rainforest without going into Corcovado? Is it even worth it to go to the area and NOT go into the park? I know it is a long journey from SJ, so we're planning to spend at least 4 days in the area. We're looking at some places that are on the beach, so we could do wildlife hikes and beach time. Any particular areas or lodging that you'd recommend? I had been looking into Amazonita Ecolodge near Dos Brazos as a mid-range solution, or Casa Bambu (maybe too expensive) in Matapalo.

I have read a lot about Manuel Antonio and I'm sure it would be more accessible and ""kid-friendly"", but it also seems like a crowded tourist magnet. If we're spending the airfare and the vacation time, we'd like to go somewhere that we can really experience the local vibe and wildlife for multiple days. We're ok with our trip being adventurous and our accommodations being sparse, as long as we are safe and can experience wildlife and make good family memories together.

Costa Rica territoriality?,"Hi peeps, I am thinking of moving to Costa Rica and establish residency. However I am confused by the tax regime. I read  income taxes go to 25%, but any income generated not within Costa Rica is not taxed due to territoriality tax laws.

"Does CR have many Guest Homes, short notice accommodations?","I'm coming to CR for the first time in a few weeks, staying for a month. I'm interested in renting a vehicle and traveling around a bit, surfing different waves and getting out into nature/parks. I would like to know, what kind of guest homes, hotels, etc. are available throughout the country?

Let me explain better . . . I lived in Sri Lanka for 2 years, and I could always easily find a cheap, basic place to stay no matter where I traveled (via moped). I could just show up, ask around, and get a place for any budget - sometimes at a family's guest home, a hostel, or a hotel. Also, I could stay as long or short term as I wanted, easily adding on more time to my stay, or just settling up my debt and moving on whenever I decided

I am trying to plan my trip  . . . not specific dates and places, but am wondering - should I try to book things in advance, or will I be OK with my usual ""show up and figure it out"" approach to travel?  And if you don't mind, what is an average cost per night for a place like this? I don't know if prices I see for online bookings are inflated . . . also I know Air BNB is very expensive too

Road Trip Questions (Lib/Monteverde/Manuel Antonio/Arenal),"I‚Äôm flying in from the US this weekend, and planning on renting a car (4wd) and driving from Liberia airport to Monteverde, then to Manuel Antonio and finally to La Fortuna over 8 days (one driving day for each leg).  I‚Äôm reading so much negativity about the roads, which is making me nervous and I want to get some advice/tips.  I live in the mountains and do some off-roading pretty regularly.  I‚Äôve also driven from Liberia to Arenal/ La Fortuna before with no problem at all.  

If I stick to Route 606 from Liberia to Monteverde, and only drive during the day, does anyone think I‚Äôll have issues with this drive?  Thanks in advance!",costarica
SJO‚Äî> La Fortuna travel question!,"
This sub has been so incredibly informative and helpful in planning my trip to CR. Thanks to everyone for sharing info and responding to questions!

Headed to CR on February 22. My flight gets in at 1pm. I‚Äôm looking for opinions/insight on best plan to get to La Fortuna. I have read often not to drive at night especially the route from SJO to LF but I really would prefer to get to LF on the 22 since I will only be there for the 23,24 (headed to MA on the 25). I don‚Äôt particularly want to spend that first night in SJO if not necessary. 

So my question is if it‚Äôs possible to land, go through customs, pick up rental car (vamos) and make it to LF by sunset (which is at 6pm). I know the drive can be around 3 hours. Is this possible? Or will getting through customs take too long and I will be stuck finishing my drive in darkness? 

Any recommendations on best plan of action?

I appreciate you all so much thanks for taking time to read my long worded question ü•¥",costarica

Is someone here going to the Envision festival?,"I've never been there haha. But I was just talking to a friend of mine and it seems like a ""one of a lifetime"" experience. 
I know it's a whole mess at the festival, a lot of drugs and alcohol everywhere, I don't know what to expect lol. As far as I know, it's a ""wholesome"" liberal thing going on, ""kind of stuff"". Idk, it's like E N V I S I O N. Everybody knows envision. 

Electronic music, art, a festival? I'm kinda lost in translation. Whatsoever üôÇ I have no idea about it. They do yoga, art presentations, artisan craftsmanship, it's a whole festival to celebrate our connection with the world and other souls to become aware of our chakras, mantras, and positive energy. A rooting experience to our ancestors and their legacy in our bones. 

Anyways, I'd love to know what your thoughts are about it are. And if you're going there. Past experiences and everything you know about it. I'm just too curious about it.

Terrorised solo female travel,"Hello everyone !
Few months ago I decided to travel alone in Costa Rica for 5 days. I am supposed to visit the Tortuguero park and cahuita park. 
My bf will join me after and we will visit the rest of the country during 2 weeks.

I live in France and I have 2 bad experiences with solo female traveling: in Morocco I got agressed (I stayed 2months on my own, 7years ago) and in Dominican Republic I got followed and harassed (only one day on my own, 1 year ago). I am tall (1m80) and I have a body that generally men notice (just saying this for the context, I get noticed in the street)

Now than the flight date is approaching I am terrorised. 
I read that solo female traveling is safe in cr but due to my past experiences I am not feeling confident at all.

Here is some of the questions I am asking to myself: 
- Can I wear shorts (or should I wear long pants)?
- I would like to take shuttle bus but I am afraid to be alone with a driver
- I would like to book some tours but I am afraid to be alone with a male guide
- I want to visit the park but I am afraid of meeting someone in the forest (like a solo man or group of men)

I know I sound paranoiac, this very short solo travel is a challenge that I wanted to take up.

Is it really safe ? How can in maximize my chance to not be aggressed ?",costarica

Sexual assault at Hacienda Guachipelin,"UPDATE: The guy was fired. 

I got a formal letter from Guachipelin confirming it. Native's Way, the tour operator that took me and the other 2 women there got involved and pressed for a resolution. I'm pleased. Of course this should have never happened but there is almost no accountability for this type of thing. I'm so thankful for this community's support. Thank you all for your comments, they've really buoyed me in this experience. <3

----------------------------

Heads up to the community about this place. I visited yesterday with a Native‚Äôs Way tour. We did the adventure combo at Guachipelin which includes zip line course. 

Part of the zip line course is a Tarzan swing where you swing and are caught on the other side. Their staff member, some teenage looking kid, caught me by the boobs - like, cupping my breasts with his hands. At first I thought maybe it was an accident but he literally had his hands on me, I was already on the ground and stable, and he‚Äôs just holding my boobs. 

Next, same kid is supposed to hook you up to the next zip line. This guy gets me all set up and connected, and now his hand is in between my legs. I literally pushed his hand off me. 

Just off the course I went to the bus where two other women in my group said the same thing happened to them by the same guy. 

I spoke with the manager and then with their general manager. It was a strange convo and I don‚Äôt know what is going or if they‚Äôve actually gotten rid of this guy. Their manager was very apologetic and said they were going to do an investigation and talk to HR, but I‚Äôm the same breath she‚Äôs telling me this might have been unintentional and just an unfortunate catch position. Let me be really clear that women know when it‚Äôs unintentional/accidental and when they are being touched inappropriately by someone who has the right cover to deny it. She also said that she asked our tour lead and other tours and no one else said anything. I hate that I need to explain to another woman that women almost always don‚Äôt come forward with this stuff. Three women on one bus don‚Äôt require extensive investigations and the secret shopper program she told me about to validate that you have a problem. 

She promised me an update on the HR meeting that I haven‚Äôt yet received. I would strongly warn others to stay away from there until they make it eminently clear how they‚Äôve handled this situation.",costarica

My neighbour's dog just attacked my dog. What do I do?,"Hey everyone,

I was looking for some advice.  Today, my dog was attacked by the neighbour's dog when my girlfriend was on a run with my dog. Their gate was left open, and they have a clearly aggressive dog.

The dog went to bite both my girlfriend (Who was trying to stop it) and my dog.  Luckily nobody was hurt, and my dog has a few bites and scratches. This could have been \*a lot\* worse. It took my neighbours a long time to come out and help stop their dog from attacking mine. My girlfriend was not able to stop their dog by herself.

Their excuse was, ""We don't know how to gate got open"", but I don't really care what their excuse is. This was neglect, and it could have caused serious harm.

I'm worried that this could happen again. What should I do to protect my girlfriend and dog in the future? Should I ring the police despite no serious harm coming to anyone? I don't want my concerns to be dismissed because the situation didn't turn out worse than it did.

I am an expat from the UK and my girlfriend is a Tica. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

I was originally a little angry when writing this post, as it was right after the incident. I've calmed down considerably. My dog went to the vet, and although not the prettiest to look at, I've decided to attach an image of the outcome.

[https://imgur.com/a/ZdEOnYl](https://imgur.com/a/ZdEOnYl)

We spoke to our neighbour, and she was extremely upset about what her dog had done and was in disbelief at her dog's behaviour. We only requested they pay for the vet bill, which they did without hesitation. We will not pursue anything further unless it happens again.

Marijuana and Hemp status in CR,"Hello visitors, thanks for your interest in visiting our country, as this is a common question we are making this sticky post and will develop some code later for the Automod in case some still ask but here's the info:

#CBD PRODUCTS

These are now fine to bring and use as they classify as food supplements, except full spectrum ones which have 0.3 THC, stick to broad spectrum or lower. 

#THC PRODUCTS

Not allowed, don't risk it, don't ask it. Only therapeutic use is approved but not implemented yet, so to try, you'll need a prescription to be safe to bring your own which will be reviewed by staff at the airport that could include a medic, **but even that is not for sure yet**, the law on this is not even 6 months old and they haven't finished it. The prescription part is only general common sense based on current status and should not be taken as official. It is safer to not bring any of this substance. 

#Marijuana plant for smoking

Not allowed to bring or sell, locally, self growing the plant for personal use is not illegal, but sharing with others or selling it is, so as a tourist there is no legal way to obtain Marijuana to smoke.

**What to do if I really really need it?**

 If you will have withdrawals from not consuming we recommend you visit at a later time, since currently there is no way to advise you on obtaining this substance legally, you can still easily find it illegally (easier than you think) but we don't recommend that and ask you not to.

*We I'll update the community when the law changes, for now any posts or comments that seem to overlook this post will be removed.

They buy people's properties at a very low price and build freaking mansions. Bloody Tuesday!! I do not think it is any fair. Like, what the hell is going on? Do we look like indigenous and illiterate people? Do we look stupid or something? Like, I do not know... it is annoying to me. And the funniest and mindblowing part is that these people who sell their properties wasted the money and ended up doing gardening for the new owners. For real, I have seen it. They basically sold everything to become employees. That is very unfortunate. Most of them have no education, they are merchants and farmers with zero to none knowledge about money, I feel like you are giving us mirrors and we are giving you our gold. Like in the ancient times with the colonizers. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, probably in 2017 a guy came around trying to buy the property of a relative, 13 hectares (130.000 squared meters). for just $1.5 millions of dollars. We did not accept the deal cause we know what they are capable of doing. So, now, the price is at least $5 millions of dollars. You could do anything you want here. Completely private, no neighbors nearby, all the property is a huge mountain, no construction, own spring of water, river around the property, and two creeks, also it has a nice lookout to La Isla del Ca√±o - and many more things. And just 4KM to the main highway. All the services are close, anything you need. The beach is just 20 minutes away. You got the best of both worlds, mountain and beach. So, I wonder how feasible is to find someone willing to pay that amount of money, if you know how to find a person interested or how to sell properties I'd be more than glad if I could know more.

Best city for remote work and dating in Costa Rica?,"I am thinking of escaping the cold in the US and working remotely from Costa Rica for January and February.  I have a few reasons for the trip:

* Tons of nature to explore!
* Spanish - I tried learning Spanish in college, but didn‚Äôt get very far.  I‚Äôve been wanting to get back into it for years, so I‚Äôm going to try forcing myself to learn.
* Dating - I am 32, male, recently single, and live in a male-dominated tech city in the US. Although I‚Äôm fairly happy with the dating scene here, I‚Äôm curious to see what dating is like outside of the US. Also, I find foreigners attractive, so I feel like I would find a larger portion of women attractive if I get out of the US.

So I‚Äôm looking for a town or city that has:

* Reliable internet for working remotely
* fun places to explore in the afternoon and evening. Parks or beaches and a decent selection of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs
* a decent-sized dating scene. Preferably a town with dating apps and/or more than just one bar with a handful of people.

I‚Äôve done an extensive amount of research, but I‚Äôm still torn. At the moment, I‚Äôm considering three cities: San Jose, Jaco Beach, and Tamarindo. Now, I have some questions.

San Jose - The city looks great in terms of bars and restaurants, and the dating scene. But I‚Äôm concerned about parks.  Is San Jose a pretty city?  Are there nice parks?  Is it safe to walk around and explore in the afternoon and night?  I will have a rental car and can explore outside the city on weekends, but it would be nice to get outside on weekdays. On a side note, I would still love suggestions for bars and restaurants, and especially nightclubs, because all of the ones I found on Google Maps are either brothels/strip clubs or closed during covid.

Jaco Beach - This is probably my top pick. It seems pretty ideal as far as internet, restaurants/bars/clubs, and the beach. My concern is about the dating scene.  I haven‚Äôt been there yet, so I‚Äôd appreciate some forgiveness, but the way others have talked about it, it sounds like there are a lot of prostitutes.  Are there also regular women that would want to go on dates, or would all of my online matches and girls I meet at bars be prostitutes? Is there a way to tell them apart, like tattoos or anything?   FTR I don't have an issue with their profession and It‚Äôs not a question of money to me. From the sound of it, most of these girls are looking for less than the cost of a normal date in the US. I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs my scene / what I‚Äôm looking for. Besides, a big reason for the dates is to meet people to explore on weekends and help me with my Spanish.

Tamarindo - It seems like a more mellow version of Jaco beach. Like, maybe there‚Äôd be less prostitution, but I‚Äôd be worried about everything else: unreliable internet, not enough bars/restaurants/clubs, and a small dating pool. Any thoughts?

Thanks for the help! I think any of these cities would be in my budget, so I‚Äôd prefer not to factor cost into the equation.  If I can‚Äôt decide, I might try to explore all three for my first week before booking a property for the remaining month or two.",costarica

"Met a girl from Costa Rica online who's having problems with abusive parents, what to do?","So there's this girl I met online just a couple weeks ago that is 17 and is having troubles to get into college, since it's expensive and she needs to get a scholarship. For that reason her mother wants to send her to live with her father since she won't be studying for a year, but she said her father is really abusive to her. And it'd be that or a shelter, where she said also happens a lot of abuse to girls. I don't know much about Costa Rica, I recommended that she should find a job to help her mother meanwhile, but she says that's very difficult as well since some places won't accept adolescents.

I'm getting really worried about her even though we just met, I would appreciate any help or guidance over what should be done in this case, she says there's no other people from her family who could help nor friends. Are there places who support teenagers in these situations? Or even a number for people who are willing to council adolescents in that situation?

&#x200B;

Edit: I found it better to stop talking to her, I'm not sure if it's a scam, but as you mentioned she seems to have opportunities better than what I could offer, and on top of that I was feeling weird  talking to a minor.  I hope it is a scam, because that's such a difficult situation for a teenager to be in...",costarica

I am organising a trip for a group of university students traveling to Costa Rica coming december.

The subject of the tour is concerning topics of Gender Equality (LHBTQ related) and Sustainability. I know there are a lot of projects around sustainability in Costa Rica but we have limited experience in your country and I thought it would perhaps be good to get some insights or connections from locals.

He appears to be nowhere near a currency exchange in his current position. The taxi companies will only accept col√≥n.  Do any of you have any resources or potential options that we could reach out to assist in this matter?

Some background on my travel preferences, I love meeting and interacting with locals and seeing local life and culture. This is the main thing I want to get out of my travels. I enjoy nature activities but don‚Äôt absolutely need it, same with beaches. A pretty beach that is over crowded with tourists and expats is basically the opposite of what I want. A place like Tamarindo, from everything I hear, is my idea of torture.

Drinking with some locals the other night, the general consensus was everything in Costa Rica is full of gringos and touristy.

I don‚Äôt need to see and do everything in Costa Rica, but would like to see a few things before moving onto Panama which I‚Äôll probably just blast through for the same reasons.

He‚Äôs a local tour guide who mainly works beachside, but he was really knowledgeable of fun things to do in the area, as well as cheap and available for any service you could need while visiting. He had access to bus connections, quad-bike rentals, boat rides, and our favorite, this outdoor river rafting,rock climbing, sauna all inclusive park. It was a really fun experience and James was crazy useful in helping us get these connections within the city.***

"He perdido la esperanza de tener una novia y cumplir mis sue√±os y deseos, soy un perdedor.","Hola, aqu√≠ otra vez yo el inc√≥gnito solitario

La verdad se que √∫ltimamente he estado publicando mucho contenido en d√≥nde menciono que nunca he tenido novia ni primer beso y que no tengo amigos y soy un fracaso, pero quiero desahogarme, la verdad no me da confianza de desahogarme con una persona as√≠ en la vida real porque probablemente me insulten o termine destruyendo la poca dignidad que me queda, es por eso que me desahogo aqu√≠ en reddit expresando la tristeza y gran desepcion que siento casi todos los d√≠as.

Bien, la verdad como dice el t√≠tulo de la publicaci√≥n he perdido casi toda la esperanza de tener una novia y cumplir con mis deseos y mis sue√±os, la verdad uno de mis sue√±os y deseos que tengo es el de tener una novia y a largo plazo mi sue√±o a cumplir con ella es tener hijos, los cuales tengo planeado llamarlos Daniel y Dylan o Nicol√°s y si son ni√±as las planeo llamar Laura y Mariana, aunque me gustaria que si tuviera novia ella eligiera un nombre para uno de nuestros hijos y cada uno le ponga un nombre a un beb√© y ser√≠a muy lindo formar una familia. Tambi√©n otro de mis deseos a largo plazo son trabajar en algo que me guste como por ejemplo algo relacionado con computaci√≥n, la verdad pr√°cticamente tengo mi vida planeada, quisiera tener una novia y despu√©s conseguir ese trabajo y una vez que est√© trabajando formar una familia para as√≠ tener la posibilidad de mantener a mi familia. Pero lamentablemente creo que todos esos deseos y sue√±os nunca lograre cumplirlos. Porque nunca he tenido novia, ni he dado mi primer beso ni siquiera un besito r√°pido y corto o beso de ""piquito"" y nunca ninguna chica se ha sentido atra√≠da por mi debido a mi voz y mi f√≠sico  y por eso talvez no pueda tener novia y tampoco formar una familia, adem√°s soy virgen y tengo la esperanza de que si alg√∫n d√≠a consigo novia ella tambi√©n sea virgen, porque quiero ser por primera vez el primero en algo y ser el primer chico de una novia y la verdad no quiero a ninguna que haya estado con otro antes que conmigo, tambi√©n soy un fracasado y no s√© hacer nada bien, soy muy malo en muchas cosas y eso me provoca tristeza.",costarica

"Traveling to C.R. with a Felony, Consulate unclear‚Ä¶ help!","Hello friends, I have plans to visit Costa Rica from the U.S. through SJO in the coming week with family for 10 days. I have a federal felony cannabis possession (with intent) conviction that is 4.5 years old, my probation is completed, and I have an unrestricted passport.
  
Everything I read online and was told by the U.S. State Department indicated I would be fine to enter Costa Rica with my criminal record.  
  
Just a couple days ago I emailed the  C.R. Consulate in LA and they responded that I would not be able to enter the country until 10 years post conviction. I did not receive an explanation.  
  
I thought the 10 year rule only applied to foreign residence in C.R., not tourists.  I am wondering if my FEDERAL felony makes any difference. 
  
According to Article 61.3 of C.R. immigration law, an impediment to entry for tourism would be conviction for a malicious crime.  
  
Is my cannabis conviction considered a malicious crime in C.R.? Should I heed the advice of the consulate and cancel my tickets?  
  
I kindly appreciate any insight anyone can give me.",costarica
Questions about life in Costa Rica," 

Hello everyone,

I have looked at the topic online, but I worry that some information is out of date, very general, or involved in advertising certain products/services.

I am a native English speaker with a university degree and CELTA certificate.  
I would like to live and teach in Costa Rica.

a) Where is the best city? I generally like large cities as I feel this is the most lively, least boring, and the best way to experience the culture (people, street food etc.)... 

b) How much can I expect to earn? From what I read online, about 500-700usd a month. Is this accurate? Is this before or after tax?

c) How much of a problem are scorpions and other harmful creatures? I hear they are not deadly, but can cause a lot of pain. Which cities will they be/not be an issue?

d) I hear ESL teachers often work on tourist visas. If possible, I would like to work with a residence visa, 1) to do things properly, and 2) so I can buy/rent a car to drive. Is this possible? If so, what are the costs?

e) How safe is Costa Rica? From my understanding, it is far less dangerous than much of central America, but not very safe like many cities in East Asia. Is it similar to major Western cities of Europe in terms of safety? street attacks, muggings, burglary etc.

f) How much does it cost for a good internet connection? I may want to supplement my earnings by working online, so a strong/stable connection is important.

g) how is dating in Costa Rica? Is it very conservative? Will a foreign man with a local woman be treated with hostility, or do people not care? (if it makes a difference, I look racially ambiguous. I could be Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, maybe South American)

Arenal - worth it despite being out of the way?,"Hi all,

I'm traveling to CR this summer with my wife and 3 kids (19, 15, 6). We were gonna fly into SJO, drive to La Fortuna, spend 3 days, then drive to the all inclusive planet hollywood west of Liberia for 3 days, then fly out of LIR. It's a whole lot of driving and it's also more expensive to split the airports like that. 

My question is, is Arenal worth the hassle? Im wondering if we could do a lot of the same things near the coast aside from the hot springs and the volcano views. I'm considering just doing the full week at Tulemar instead. 

Would I regret not going to Arenal? Thanks all!",costarica
"Creo que he desperdiciado mi adolescencia, es algo muy triste.","Hola, aqu√≠ el inc√≥gnito solitario.

Me gustaria expresar que me he sentido muy triste y deprimido porque creo que he desperdiciado por completo mi adolescencia, se supone que la adolescencia es una etapa la cual hay que disfrutar al m√°ximo porque en esa etapa estamos llenos de energ√≠a y todo eso jeje y hay que disfrutarla ""viviendo experiencias al m√°ximo"" como por ejemplo la incre√≠ble y m√°gica experiencia de tener el primer amor adolecente o novia, ese amor que seg√∫n he escuchado aparenta ser un amor verdadero y que va a durar por siempre aunque no es as√≠, tambi√©n en esa etapa muchos experimentan su ""primera vez"" y salen a fiestas con amigos y se divierten. Pero toda mi adolescencia he estado solo, la verdad no he tenido novia y tampoco muchos amigos y no he tenido la oportunidad de vivir y disfrutar esas incre√≠bles experiencias en mi adolescencia mientras otros si. Es algo muy triste porque la adolescencia no dura para siempre y me hubiera gustado vivir en mi adolescencia todas esas experiencias, la verdad a√∫n no ha acabado mi adolescencia, pero ya falta poco y voy a terminar sin haber disfrutado para nada mi adolescencia como todas las personas normales lo hacen. Me hubiera gustado disfrutar mi adolescencia con una novia, tener mi primer beso, mi primera vez y salir a fiestas y divertirme con amigos, pero soy feo y tengo una voz poco atractiva y por eso nunca he tenido novia y por eso nunca he tenido mi primer beso y tampoco mi primera vez.

American for digital nomad visa,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm an American currently trying to work with my US based company to obtain a digital nomad visa. I got 2/3 of the approvals needed to make the move but was denied by my final approver due to them saying they would need to establish a legal entity in Costa Rica for the move. 

From my research online, I don‚Äôt see any requirements from businesses to establish a legal entity and was wondering if Costa Rica had an exception of this rule.

My assumption is that leadership just didn‚Äôt do any research and pushed it aside with not looking into the digital nomad visa at all.

‚ÄúTodo mundo sabe gracias a usted y varios me dieron la raz√≥n. Metase un dedo entre el culo y DEJE DE MOLESTAR‚Äù

...Jej. Incluso despu√©s de actuar como si ya no le molestaba. Incluso despu√©s de estar hablando completamente normal conmigo, en vez de comunicar que eso todav√≠a la afectaba... o al menos eso... ¬øpienso?

...Fue innumerable la cantidad de veces que yo le rogu√© a usted para que me perdonara. Tantas veces. Tanto que yo llor√© por esto, por perder tantas amistades por algo tan estupido... pero... despu√©s de casi 2 a√±os desde que usted me invit√≥ a algo en donde yo pens√© que quer√≠a hablar conmigo... me di cuenta de algo; usted ten√≠a raz√≥n. En el momento que usted me dijo ‚ÄúNo‚Äù yo tuve que haber parado, yo tuve que haberme quedado callado, yo tuve que haberme puesto en una esquina y no decirle nada m√°s, y yo lo he lamentado por varios meses. Lo siento. Pero... ¬øsabe que? ...usted jug√≥ con mi culpa, y cualquier persona que diga que ‚ÄúNo‚Äù es un severo bruto. Usted le hab√≠a quedado claro que fue un accidente, que yo no sab√≠a, que yo estaba nervioso. Usted fingi√≥ haber quedado bien conmigo despu√©s de las innumerables cantidades de veces que yo le ped√≠ disculpas a usted y al grupo, ¬ø...y pasar esas √∫ltimas 2 semanas habl√°ndome completamente normal conmigo como si ya no le molestara lo qu√© pas√≥ entre nosotros, solo para despu√©s volverme a cagar por algo que usted en varias ocasiones admiti√≥ que ya le daba igual...? Mandarme todos esos audios donde se mor√≠a de la risa, cuando yo estaba sufriendo, cuando usted ten√≠a bien claro que ansiedad social y temor a ser juzgado era mi principal inseguridad, aprovecharse de eso, sin tomar en cuenta la mierda por la que estaba pasando en casa por problemas familiares esos d√≠as, diciendo que le ‚Äúval√≠a picha que yo llorara‚Äù y que no le importaba como yo me sent√≠a, que solo me iba a tratar as√≠ porque ‚Äúle daba la gana‚Äù... me hace pensar... aunque yo hice algo malo... aunque yo ‚Äúacos√©‚Äù... Me cuestiono si yo realmente fui el malo despu√©s de todo el resto. 

...y de nada ayud√≥ que despu√©s de eso, mi familia, mi mam√° me segu√≠a llamando un ‚Äúin√∫til‚Äù y un pendejo por lo qu√© pas√≥, o a mi t√≠a que se pon√≠a a decirme que ‚Äúnada fue mi culpa‚Äù, en vez de resaltar mi error. No t√≠a, si lo fue. Hasta cierto punto, si lo fue, y yo me odio a mi mismo por no haberme dado cuenta hasta hoy en d√≠a. Ten√≠a 16 a√±os. Yo no sab√≠a. Yo solo quer√≠a caer bien, pero yo siempre tuve que haberla cagado, porque es lo √∫nico que sabia hacer.

En poco m√°s de un mes, por septiembre, esos compa√±eros van a ir a una fiesta de graduaci√≥n en unos moteles lindisimos. Si eso no hubiera pasado, yo hubiera podido ir con ellos... pero ya no puedo. Yo quiero ver a los chiquillos de nuevo, quiero hablar con ellos, PERO YA NO PUEDO... por que a pesar de que antes me dec√≠an que me quer√≠an y que me apreciaban, y que ellos quer√≠an que yo pasara tiempo con ellos, nadie realmente tuvo la energ√≠a, inter√©s, o ganas de llegar a un acuerdo despu√©s de lo qu√© pas√≥ entre ella y yo. Yo llevo meses de no hablar con los otros maes. A nadie le import√≥ simplemente arreglar las cosas, para que yo pudiera ser feliz otravez, para que ya pudiera hablar con ellos de nuevo... no... y eso demuestra lo que yo realmente val√≠a.

...que gracioso, y que satisfacci√≥n, irme. Irme durante esos d√≠as. Aunque sea fingir mi hijueputa suicidio, publicar una nota y desaparecer, aunque sea por 5 d√≠as, para que ellos se den cuenta despu√©s de tanto tiempo como yo me he sentido. Para que por fin sientan la misma culpabilidad, ansiedad, y tristeza que yo he sentido a lo largo de estos casi 2 a√±os. Que risa seria, que todo mundo se d√© cuenta de lo que ella hizo, y que la haga a ella de verdad reflexionar sobre c√≥mo realmente me trat√≥, y que les remuerda la consciencia pensar en que ya no estoy, mientras iban planeando un viaje como si nada... 

yo solo... solo quiero que todo mundo, mi familia, mis antiguos amigos, los que tengo ahorita, que todos, se den cuenta de esto... que por fin me puedan crear. Y si el plan fracasa... pues nada m√°s termino en matarme de verdad.

La verdad. A mi ya no me importa nada. Solo ya no quiero sentirme as√≠ mas. Es mucha culpabilidad y resentimiento mezclado. 

No hay un solo d√≠a que no llore. Que no sue√±e en otro mundo donde nada de esto pas√≥. Ya solo quiero irme.",costarica

Necesito Ayuda,"Hola gente,

La vara es que ped√≠ unas vitaminas de ashwaghanda por internet y utilic√© correos Box para el servicio de transporte.

Cuando el paquete lleg√≥ aqu√≠ me empezaron a pedir ""Permisos especiales"" que me parecen s√∫per exagerados.

Me pidieron lo siguiente:
- Una carta al ministerio de salud
- Una carta a Aduanas
- Una carta importador
- Ficha t√©cnica del producto
- Factura + Firma
- Receta M√©dica

Adem√°s de que me cobran lo siguiente:
- $10 por el permiso
- $10 por bodega (durante 15 d√≠as, posterior el precio sube a $50)
- Y por su puesto el servicio de transporte y los impuestos (C√≥mo siempre).

Me parece exagerado que me pidan tantas cosas, c√≥mo si hubiera comprado un f√°rmaco nuclear o algo as√≠. Son solo pastillas de una planta natural. Tengo la sensaci√≥n de que esto es solo para sacarle a uno m√°s dinero.

Honeymoon in Costa Rica,"
My husband and I are planning our honeymoon for January in Costa Rica. There are so many incredible places we want to visit and could use some experts advice!!
We are hoping to do 10-14 days total depending on the cost:


Arenal (3 days)
Monteverde(2 days) 
Uvita (3 or 4 days)  
Osa Penninsula (4 days)


I would appreciate any tips or recommendations. 
We  are currently trying to decide if we should rent a car for part of our trip or if a transportation company would be less stressful getting from place to place.


 Also if there is a better order to visit these destinations please let me know.


I am certain this won't be out last trip to Costa Rica so whatever we can't see this trip we will have to come back to experience. 


If anyone has flown Sansa air (to travel to Drake bay) is it a very expensive flight? (We are thinking just one way to get back to the airport on our way home)",costarica
Friend stuck in Bathroom!!!,"A few of us went on vacation to Costa Rica for spring break. An absolutely beautiful country as you all know. Anywho, we are staying in a nice AirBnB that we rented for the week and all was going well these past few days. Soaking up the sun's rays and swimming in the beautiful water has been just a blast! However, things recently took a turn for the worse. My friend went to shower in one of our bathrooms and, after all was said and done, he tried to exit. But alas, the door would not open! He tells me, and I quote, ""The door handle will turn but the thing that closes the door won't work!"" I haven't a clue what he's referring to, perhaps the cheesy pizza piece that slides in and out? It is beyond my knowledge. He's been in there for a few hours now and we are starting to lose hope. The worst part is that he really needs to go pee, so we have to get him out of there fast! Any tips or advice? Has this happened to any Costa Ricans before? Let us know! 
Thank you and Pura Vida!

Picking a city,"I am planning on spending three months in CR, main purpose is to immerse myself in Spanish, so I can learn it quickly.

I would have to find a Spanish tutor during the evening hours. Some of the things that I would want is:

\- Furnished studio or one bedroom- Inexpensive- Safe- Quiet- Ideally close to the ocean, if not on the waterfront- Chance to mix with locals so my Spanish can improve exponentially- FAST and RELIABLE Internet, my job is all online

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you! I am also considering Bogota and Mexico, but CR seems to be a better choice financially and also safety wise, unless I am mistaken?

Edit: I am hoping to find some native teacher, instead of giving with a program for foreigners. Fully local experience. So away from tourist spots and corporations that overcharge foreigners to learn.",costarica

Context:

* We arrive in San Jose on May 23, and leave May 31st
* Renting a SUV for the time
* Younger members of the family can do intensive physical activity with altitude, but older members will take it slower

* Monteverde on May 26 - 28
* Manuel Antonio on May 28 - 30
* San Jose on May 30 - 31

Questions:

* Is this too much in this short time? How would you adjust the schedule?
* Total drive time on Google Maps says 12 hours for all destination is 12 hours - however, this assumes no problem on the road, is this realistic?

We are planning to stay in Costa Rica untill the 25th of September 2021. 

Our second Pfizer vaccination is taking place on 31 August 2021.

This means that 14 days after our second Pfizer vaccination is on the 14th of September 2021.

Do we need to take a travel insurance policy, with coverage of the stated COVID-19 costs by the Costa Rican government, untill the 14th of September 2021?

Because after the 14th of September 2021 we are fully vaccinated for 14 days or more.


Also; if we need to take an insurance, is Trawick - Safe Travels International the best option for us as a Dutch citizen? Has anyone experience with Trawick?",costarica

Thinking of moving to Costa Rica,"Hi all, I am a Canadian thinking of moving to Costa Rica.

I hear there is even an area called ""little Canada"" because there are so many Canadians there.  I might like to join, but curious opinions of life there.  Russian, Chinese influence?  Authoritarian there like Canada is becoming?  Free speech?  Lifestyle in general?  Expenses for average person?

We‚Äôd like to get connected with local home school groups. 

We‚Äôd like to live different places. Ideally both in a beachside villa and mountain villa. I was thinking beach in the spring and fall and mountains in the summer and winter. Maybe 3-6 months in a place. 

We can probably afford about $1800 /m Canadian for rent. 
We‚Äôd love the jungle cabin experience. 

We would prefer slightly rural,  but with internet that can handle zoom. 

We‚Äôd like to have a 2 wheel drive vehicle.Seems likely I would buy and then sell if we are there a year.

Police took license plates from multiple cars after parking on a public road in Las Catalinas in Guanacaste.,"So I‚Äôm on vacation with my parents and today we decided to go to Las Catalinas as we are staying in Playa Flamingo. We parked on a public road along with many other people and everything was fine until we came back to our car an hour later. The traffic cops gave every car parked on the road a ticket AND also removed everyone‚Äôs license plates from their cars. I understand the ticket but taking the plates is just too much. Now we might have to go to Liberia just to get the plates back and pay the fine which is inconvenient. My mom is from Costa Rica  and she said things like this tend to happen a lot. Also, we didn‚Äôt see any signs on the road telling us not to park nor were there any painted lines indicating a no parking zone. We tried talking to the police along with other ticked drivers but they said they can‚Äôt do anything. Now I‚Äôm wondering what solutions there are to this and if the ticket can be appealed.",costarica

Question about Cannabis in CR,"Hey everyone! 

This might be a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I am prepared for my trip to CR in June. I am a medical cannabis patient for complex PTSD. Other medications do not work and are not an option. I understand that cannabis was recently vetoed for medical use, however it is fairly easy to obtain in CR as long as you ask the right people. 

My main concern comes down to how much I can reasonably obtain during my stay being a tourist. I am pretty spoiled with American cannabis and usually it‚Äôs way more potent than anywhere else I travel. Basically this means that I‚Äôm going to need a lot more than your average tourist, and I‚Äôm wondering how easy it‚Äôll be to obtain 1-2 ounces while Im there. Basically what I‚Äôm asking is if I should start looking online for a reliable person, or will I have no trouble finding an ounce or two just by asking around? Knowing this ahead of time will be fantastic, because I‚Äôd love to scout instagram for a solid connection before arriving if I need to. Ill be staying in Quepos and La Fortuna if that helps at all. Thank you all for the help!!",costarica

Help me decide which destinations to visit in June!,"Hello! I am planning a honeymoon for June 2023 in Costa Rica. We are flying in during the middle of the night on June 18 and leave the afternoon of July 3rd out of SJO. So we have about two weeks.

We are very adventurous people, and would like to avoid the more touristy places in an effort to both save money, and get a little more ""authentic"" experience. I have 2 free nights with Marriott so might end up in a more touristy place to use those. And to be clear, we don't mind touristy, just enjoy getting off the beaten path too. We intend to rent a car, and I have experience driving in third world countries so I am not too concerned.

We are trying to decide how many of the following destinations we can reasonably hit spending 2-4 days in each location. Which ones are worth making an effort for and which ones should be pass on? I have listed locations below and how we have perceived them so far. We don't want to overfill out trip of course, but we don't want to be stagnant for toooo long.

&#x200B;

* **La Fortuna**: Jungle, wildlife, hiking, zip line, hot springs, etc.
* **Monteverde:** More jungle wildlife stuff, but potentially cooler weather, less people, and more cloud forest than La Fortuna? 
* **Guancaste:** A few nice Marriott resorts we could spend a night or two at. Nice beaches?
* **Manuel Antonio:** Lots of tourist, but lots of wildlife and stunning beaches? Expensive.
* **Osa Peninsula/Drakes Bay:** Off the beaten path, lots of wildlife, maybe not ideal for rainy season?Super interested in the overnight hikes into Corcovado.
* **Puerto Viejo:** Lots of cool animal sanctuaries. Keep finding places I want to stay here. Just far away from everything. Seems to have a nice blend of everything
* **Tortuguero:** Sea turtles perhaps? Is it worth visiting otherwise? The ""arrive by boat"" thing sounds pretty cool.
* **Turrialba:** Mountains/highlands. Seems like a good location to finish on maybe due to proximity to sjo.
* **Cerro Chirripo:** I hear this one isn't good during rainy season, but we would be super interested in potentially a summit, or at least spending some time in the highlands. Not sure how to do that though.

&#x200B;

I was originally thinking SJO - La Fortuna - Monteverde - Jaco (one night to use Marriott) - Manuel Antonio - Osa - Turrialba - SJO.  But I think that would be too much right?

And then I later thought SJO - Tortuguero - La Fortuna - Guancaste (Marriott) - Monteverde - SJO but I didn't like the idea of missing out on Osa, and it felt like all pretty touristy locations.

I recently discovered Puerto Viejo and it is rapidly climbing the list as a place worth visiting. But its pretty far away from other notable locations.

Surfing/Jungle Suggestions,"Hi all, I know Surf School suggestions etc.. have been asked before, but perhaps not together as a single trip suggestion?

My wife and I want to fly down to Costa Rica for 1.5-2week trip. We want to explore both the Jungle (hike & document fungi) as well as spend time at the beach learning to surf & yoga. 

Can anyone suggest a route to take? We would like to minimize travel as much as possible, e.g. not wanting to double back nor drive for hours. 

So looking for an itinerary/route as far as which airport and cities we should focus on searching for hotels and such.

Thank you.",costarica

How to transfer money to Costa Rica from another country when arranging investment residency?,"Hi guys!   
As I already know in order to meet the requirements on investment residency permit a future expat has to invest 150k USD (200k according to some sources) into Costa Rican real estate. The question is - how do you actually move the money to Costa Rica? Can you open a bank account in CR while being a foreigner? If yes, then are you allowed to do it remotely (I mean without being physically present in Costa Rica)? If no, then are there limitations or requirements on how many money in cash can you bring to CR? The country of my origin has no direct flights to CR unfortunately, so carrying cash is not a perfect option because some other countries along the way have their own cash import/export requirements, fees and limits. Please advise and have a wonderful day! Thank you!",costarica

Any recommendations for big day hikes that we can do without a guide? Up to 25km,"We are from Vancouver, BC and enjoy hiking the mountains here. Planning a trip down to Costa Rica and having trouble finding some good day hikes. There are a lot of little hikes here and there, and then longer ones that you seem to need a guide. Just wondering if there are any you know of that don't need a guide?

We'd be comfortable with up to 25km with 1500m elevation gain. Would want a good payoff though for something that long.

We are spending 21 days in Costa Rica and will be all over, to the Caribbean Coast to Monteverde/La Fortuna, Liberia, Jaco, Drake Bay, etc.

Going to Costa Rica for 1 month - any tips welcomed!,"Hello r/costarica ! 

I am planning on coming to Costa Rica for the whole month of March with a friend of mine. We are both French in our twenties and both never have been to your beautiful country, and can't wait for it! 

We are currently looking for an accomodation, and have litterally no idea what to do haha

Our plan is to find a spot that is quite central for the whole month, preferably close (+/- 30mn max) to beaches where we can surf at a beginner level. We are in a super chill mood, not looking to necessary explore everywhere and backpack around, but more in the vibe of finding a sweet paradisiac spot and then do 1 or 2-day trips around the country by driving around to discover.

Therefore, my questions are the following:

\- First, what's the Covid situation like? It seems from here that it is fine, open borders etc., but is there any sign that the situation might change between now and end of Feb./beginning of March? 

\- What area would you recommend for us to stay for a full month? 

\- Does it seem at all like a good idea to stay a full month in one spot? Or maybe to make sure we see the most even in our chill mood would it be better to do like 2 weeks somewhere North and 2 weeks somewhere South and then advise on daily trips around?

Help needed after inheriting land in Costa Rica,"We are from Europe. A relative passed away a couple of years ago and when looking into the estate we found that her asset manager scammed her into multiple worthless investments a long time ago. We have been to the police, apparently he was a known scammer who is already convicted, most of her money is gone.

One of the less evil scams was the purchase of a 250 acre piece of land in canton San Carlos, Alajuela, Costa Rica. In 1996 she paid a ridiculous amount of money for it, but she does really seem to own it. Her name is on the official documents we purchased from rnpdigital (registro nacional).

My family contacted a realtor in Costa Rica that they found online to try and have the land sold. However now this realtor tried to scam them so this was a dead end. We don't really know how to proceed and I hope one of you can point us in the right direction.

We mainly have the following questions:

1. How do we get a reliable estimate of what the land is actually worth today
2. How would we go about selling it without getting scammed along the way
3. The land is in her name but she has passed away. How do we deal with this
4. Due to a miscommunication we are behind on the property tax. We can pay it now, but the amount seems to be based on the price paid for the land which was A LOT. Is there a procedure to correct this to the real value so the property tax becomes fair?

PS: I am on a throwaway but have been a subscriber of r/costarica after touring your beautiful country for a month a couple of years ago. We went to many of the national parks, met with many locals and it was the best holiday of our lives. Pura Vida and thank you!",costarica
How Canadian can apply for Costa Rica Visa?,"Are you a Canadian resident and planning for [***Costa Rica Relocation***](https://www.shippingcostarica.net/costa-rica-relocation-moving-shipping-to-costa-rica/)**?** If yes, then you need to apply for passport. Canadian passport holders can travel to Costa Rica as tourists for up to a maximum 90 days, no visa is required but all the following requirements for entry must be met. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1y3xe22dqvu81.jpg?width=1140&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=095245e97bd7682d963098dd91793412405803e2

1. A valid passport which must have validity of at least 1 day left. 

2. Proof of economic solvency of at least US $ 100 per month of legal permanence in the country

3. A ticket to exit Costa Rica within the maximum authorized period of 90 days and 

4. Not having an impediment of entry into the country.

As per Article 61.3 of Immigration law of Costa Rica, you would have an impediment to enter Costa Rica if you have a criminal conviction for a malicious crime in last 10 years as long as the offense is both illegal in Canada and Costa Rica. 

Also, Canadian people with precautionary measures, pending criminal processes for sex crimes against under age people or that have been convicted of sex crimes against minors in the last 50 years.

The maximum authorized period for tourism is 90 days. Also, there is no procedure for a visa/permanence extension beyond 90 days. To be considered as a tourist, Costa Rica uses the definition of tourism set by World Tourism organization that indicates that tourism comprises any activity done during the trip for leisure, business or professional reasons as long as they are not being remunerated or lucrative in Costa Rica.

**Canadian permanent residents and holders of Canadian work or student visas**

Permanent residents of Canada or bearers of student or work visa duly stamped in their passport that allows multiple entries are exempt from Costa Visa tourist visa. As long as both the passport of their nationality and permanent resident card or student/work visa has at least 6 months left of validity at the moment of entry into Costa Rica.

It is however imperative to meet the following entry requirements: 

1. Valid passport

2. Canadian permanent resident card or Canadian multiple entry work/student Visa stamped in the passport to be presented at the point of entry in Costa Rica. 

3. Proof of economic solvency of at least US$ 100 per person per month

4. A ticket to exit Costa Rica within the maximum authorized period of 30 days

5. Not having an impediment of entry into the country.

If you have a permanent resident card or a work study visa in Canada but it has less than 6 months of validity from the moment of your entry in Costa Rica then you will need to apply for a consular Costa Rica Visa.

**Canadian Refugee**

Canadian Permanent resident card holders that have Canadian travel document instead of passport because they have refugee status in Canada would need to apply for a consulated Visa with the immigration authority of Costa Rica. 

If you are into **shipping to Costa Rica** it is important that you work with a good shipping company who will furnish all the custom formalities for helping easy shipment of goods.",costarica

Me he rendido porque nunca voy a tener novia por culpa de mi voz fea y mi f√≠sico nada atractivo pero conservar√© un poco de esperanza.,"Hola, aqu√≠ estoy otra vez yo el incognito solitario. Perd√≥n si p√∫blico lo mismo muchas veces o solo cuento historias tristes, pero historias tristes es lo √∫nico que tengo que contar porque la verdad las √∫nicas experiencias felices que he tenido fueron hace muchos a√±os en mi infancia cuando solo ten√≠a 5 a√±os, la verdad a los 5 a√±os considero que fue mi √∫ltima √©poca de felicidad verdadera y sin ningunas preocupaciones y adem√°s en esa √©poca ten√≠a m√°s amigos, recuerdo lo divertido que era cuando estaba en la escuela con mis amigos, era muy divertido siempre mis amigos y yo en el recreo jug√°bamos con peque√±os autos de juguete y con plastilina y la verdad esa fue una √©poca muy feliz, la mejor para m√≠. Despu√©s de los 5 a√±os si fue una √©poca feliz pero fue empeorando con el tiempo, en fin volviendo con el tema.

No me gusta para nada mi f√≠sico y tampoco mi voz, la verdad he intentado cambiar eso, he intentado muchas cosas para mejorar ciertos aspectos que no me gustan para nada de mi rostro y  tambi√©n he intentado mejorar mi voz intentando imitar un ""acento"" diferente cuando hablo con las personas ya que no puedo cambiar mi voz pero si puedo hacer que se escuche mejor para los dem√°s, en fin. C√≥mo ya he  mencionado en otras publicaciones he sufrido rechazo y Bullying debido a factores como mi f√≠sico y mi voz  pero eso fue cuando ten√≠a 13 a√±os, pero a√∫n me duelen esos insultos que me dec√≠an, me dec√≠an feo, retraso, enfermo y tambi√©n siempre en deportes o tareas en equipo me dejaban por fuera y recuerdo que siempre que preguntaba si pod√≠a integrarme a su equipo me dec√≠an excusas como: no ya estamos completos y el maestro me asignaba a un grupo aleatorio y lograba ver la reacci√≥n de desagrado de los otros miembros, adem√°s recuerdo que una vez una maestra nos dijo de conformar equipos con la persona que estaba al lado de nuestra mesa y una chica que se encontraba al lado m√≠o ser√≠a mi equipo pero le dijeron de hacer equipo conmigo y  ella respondi√≥ de mala manera y eso me doli√≥ porque escuch√© y pues no quer√≠a hacer equipo conmigo y no entend√≠a porque si nunca le hab√≠a hecho nada malo adem√°s la manera en como respondi√≥ me dej√≥ m√°s que claro que me odiaba sin raz√≥n, tambi√©n en deportes siempre era el √∫ltimo en ser elegido por quienes conformaban el equipo o me dejaban por fuera, est√° bien que talvez no se jugar deportes como el f√∫tbol pero no estaban jugando ning√∫n mundial ni nada, que ten√≠a de malo perder por malos jugadores como yo?, Tambi√©n recuerdo que una vez hablando con un amigo y preguntaron algo y dije la misma respuesta que el, otro dijo que yo era un copi√≥n y una chica a su lado se ri√≥ y dijo: jaja si por eso nadie lo va a querer, fue algo hiriente en mi opini√≥n. Adem√°s intentaba integrarme con otros pero me dec√≠an que me hiciera a un lado o me fuera y me dec√≠an que no jugar√° y deb√≠a pasar solo los recreos, adem√°s recuerdo que lo m√°s deprimente era los 14 de febrero en la escuela todos regalaban rosas y cartas a sus parejas pero yo nunca tuve pareja y me hac√≠a sentir triste, afortunadamente ten√≠a un mejor amigo que compart√≠a la misma situaci√≥n que yo y tratamos de ver el lado bueno y hacer bromas de estar solos el 14 de febrero y me hac√≠a sentir mejor, tambi√©n nunca le he gustado a ninguna chica nunca, es por eso que he tomado ciertas desiciones un poco derrotistas  y algunas de ellas debo admitir que algunas son opciones muy  exageradas  por as√≠ decirlo, como por ejemplo comenzar a usar una m√°scara para que nadie vea mi f√≠sico, la verdad no tengo ninguna deformidad ni nada por el estilo pero es una opci√≥n y otra opci√≥n es no hablar mucho y solo utilizar monos√≠labos como Si o No en las conversaciones para no hablar mucho y que nadie escuch√© mi voz, la verdad estas opciones las planee hace poco tiempo cuando decid√≠ que me rend√≠ por  completo debido a que me enamor√© de una chica y vi que tampoco era para m√≠, siempre me enamoro y nunca ninguna es para m√≠, es una tristeza en fin ese d√≠a al ver que claramente talvez est√° interesada en otra persona tome la desicion de que obviamente nunca ninguna ser√° para m√≠ y lo mejor ser√° rendirme y jam√°s en mi solitaria vida volver a pensar que le gustare a ninguna chica porque obviamente ninguna gustaria de mi,  recuerdo que ese d√≠a en mi propia mente tuve una larga conversaci√≥n conmigo mismo en la cual logr√© convencerme de rendirme y jam√°s volver a intentar nada con ninguna chica, porque soy un perdedor tengo un f√≠sico y voz horrible, talvez ya declare mi rendici√≥n, pero a√∫n quiero tener algo de esperanza por lo menos unos pocos a√±os m√°s.",costarica

**I'm a Canadian who just got back from a month living in Costa Rica.** 

**Predictably, coming from a cold and sterile environment, it was like getting hit in the face with the entire National Geographic Channel every time I looked around. I realized that my house back home was a sealed box sitting on a pile of snow.**

**But as a square Anglo-saxon type, it was the warmth and charm of this highly cultured and very romantic society that changed me the most. Life and love come first here, and that mindset is genuine and inclusive. I learned more life lessons from Costa Rican friends than from all the toucans, sloths and monkeys I saw put together!**

Costa Rican society and racism,"Hi, I have been living here for just under a decade. I am married to a Tica and I live in a rural mountain area. I farm and I use Nicaraguan labor. I could not find Ticos to do the work. My wife began expressing very racist attitudes towards the Nicaraguans, then she extended it to natives. She wants me to follow her lead and be Tico, but I take very good care of my Nicaraguan laborers because I respect them. Their work ethic is as good as any I have ever seen, like Italians and Portuguese doing construction in North America, and so I take care of them. I pay above what I can get away with. I help with problems and emergencies, and I even want to get them a dental plan, but my wife puts up so much resistance. I don't know what to do? My wife thinks extra money should be spent on her family and not Nicaraguans, but my brothers-in-law are the laziest people I know, and giving them something for nothing just seems wrong to me. What should I do here?",costarica

Positive Covid Test and Aftermath During Recent Trip,"I want to share my experience after testing positive during a recent trip to Costa Rica.  It's long but I would have welcomed this info after testing positive.

Before the trip:  Vaccinated in May.  No known exposure prior to the trip.  No symptoms.  I saw that the country was on the CDC list of hot spots and considered cancelling the trip.  However, having bought the mandatory insurance to enter the country, the assurances from the hotel of their precautions, the plan to be outdoors most of the time, and my stupid optimism from having avoided contracting the virus until now, I decided to go.

During the trip:  Masks were required and enforced at indoor establishments.  Hand washing stations were set up before entering many stores and attractions.  Overall, people were on board with wearing masks but less stringent on distancing.  It seemed the country was desperate for the tourists to come back and the people were doing their part in making it more attractive for visitors as well as keeping government restrictions from expanding.

Testing:  Two days prior to departing, the hotel in Jac√≥ arranged with the local clinic to come to our room for the test - $135 with results promised in about 24hours.  Your passport number will be recorded.  There are plenty of posts and resources about getting the test so won't say anymore other than ""thank you"" to those posters.

Results:  My test came back via email as positive, as well as my companion's.  This was a bit shocking as neither of us had any symptoms and were vaccinated.  A little later, the Health Ministry sent an notification email telling me that they were aware of my positive test result.  Some time later, they followed it up with the official Sanitary Order directing me to quarantine for 10 days.  All communications were in Spanish and had to be translated.  The Order directed that I stay in the current hotel room.  My companion received the same communications, usually a few hours after mine.

Quarantine:  We were in transit to Alajuela when the emails came through so we had already checked out of the room specified by the Sanitary Order.  We did our quarantine at the HIX by SJO.  Not being sure about the ramifications, I did not notify the hotel of our order.  Since we extended there by 10 days, I'm sure they figured it out.  Neither one of us had symptoms during the quarantine. 

Follow-ups:  I received one email from the Ministry of Health (in English) reiterating the order and asking for a photo of my passport.  Other than that, no one checked on us.  No one called.  No one would reply to any emails I sent asking questions, both in English and later in Spanish as I became more desperate for answers.  We probably could have come and gone as we pleased but restricted our movements to just two trips off premises to the local super for food and supplies.  After 10 days, the Ministry of Health sent an email stating the quarantine was over - but to not use that email as an official letter of recovery.

Insurance:  Had mine through Sagicor and had no problems as they are staffed with English speakers.  The insurance specified that we needed to do our quarantine in a hotel previously reserved - didn't really pay attention to this fine print but that's what we ended up doing so this was good.  Still need to submit my reimbursement claim.

Airlines:  SWA didn't care that the reason I had to change my flight was beyond my control.  Had to pay the fare difference for the new flight.

Letter of Recovery:   In order to fly back to the US, you either need a negative test result or a letter of recovery issued by a medical professional if you tested positive.  There was very little information about how one goes about getting this.  It turns out the Ministry of Health sends this out automatically after the completion of the quarantine.  It would have been nice if they told us this at the beginning - that despite not having seen me or monitored my condition for the past 10 days, a ""medical professional"" would be sending me a letter that I had sufficiently recovered from Covid. 

Issues:  While my companion got the letter of recovery, I did not.  My countless emails requesting help were unanswered.  My companion twice received email responses so there are people at the Health Ministry capable of answering English emails - just not mine, apparently.  In one of their responses they say they cannot find me in their system.  I called and got a English speaker after being bounced around.  She gave me two phone numbers and another email address to try.  The email was never answered.  The first number would not connect.  The second number was staffed by a gentleman who insisted that no one there could speak English.  Ok, I could have been more studious when I was learning Spanish so I could do more than greet people and order my casasdo con pescado.  Soon it was Friday afternoon and with my flight scheduled Monday, I knew I needed a different solution.

There were suggestions that I just needed to take the Covid test again but that had risks.  If I tested positive again, I would have to repeat the quarantine cycle - this time with no insurance coverage.  I was in no mood to hole up for another 10 days.  Plus it was more money out of pocket for the test.  

On Saturday, I went to the 24hr trauma center in La Fortuna (making my way to LIR for a cheaper flight and to see the forests) and showed them my companion's letter of recovery and tried to communicate that I needed one like it.  It was going nowhere until the doctor came out and quickly grasped the situation and said he could do it!  He did an actual physical exam and used my companion's letter as a model to construct his own through some kind of official web portal.  He gave me his number just in case the airlines had any issues and then recommended some local hot springs to chill now that this worry was resolved.  He was awesome.  SWA scrutinized the letter line by line but it passed muster and I was able to depart.  

In the gap between the time the quarantine was over (10 days) and when you're allowed to fly back (14 days), we did explore the Arenal region so that was a bonus.

If you've read this far, you may be going through a similar situation - perhaps there was something helpful in the words above and hope you have a quick recovery.  

Meanwhile the Ministry of Health continues its steady silence.

I'm without a car, and while researching my transfer options I found that the cheapest, shortest option was the most intriguing. It involves taking a Van to the lake, a boat across the lake and another van into the mountains to Monteverde.

DO THIS!!! The lake trip was beautiful and tranquil with an amazing view of Volcan Arenal. I experienced some of the most beautiful vistas of my life on the way to Monteverde.

Does anyone here live or work in Costa Rica or have access to anyone who works at Hospital San Juan de Dios?? I posted the following earlier on another page but hoping someone can PLEASE help me!! Its been almost 36 hours since my last update and I am going insane:

My sons dad (also one of my bests friends)‚Ä¶ was in a Costa Rica on vacation and went to hospital with extreme low oxygen levels. Over the weekend he took a turn for the worst. He‚Äôs on life support in ICU. on pressors for low blood pressure. Serious lung infection. They had to turn him onto stomach because even with ventilator his oxygen was low.

I‚Äôm here in the US trying to hold my shit together. Our son is ten years old. The communication absolutely sucks. They are communicating with one person in our family maybe once a day if that.

I‚Äôm trying to get an expedited passport and finally got my letter from the embassy today. But still have to wait for appointment.

Was wondering #1, if anyone has anything they can say to calm my head. #2, does anyone have connections to passport office, #3 does anyone here live/work in Costa Rica (San Jose hospital).

That‚Äôs a lot to ask but you don‚Äôt know unless you try!!!! I am completely helpless useless and information less and it‚Äôs making me insane!!!!!Ôøº",costarica

Need help regarding a potential scam in Costa Rica,"Hiya, 

I‚Äôm really not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am looking for any information or other people that could have been affected by this. 

My father was teaching English with a charity organisation outside of San Jos√© called ALIARSE just before the pandemic hit. They presented and investment opportunity with a Credit Union to both himself and many of his colleagues. It was presented as a government backed project that through this credit union it would be helping underprivileged and uneducated Costa Rican nationals get into employment. Himself and many of his colleagues invested into this as they were told it was a guaranteed to be safe and they would not loose anything.

My father invested ¬£80,000 ($92,000) into this. Himself and his colleagues have never heard back from this investment or been able to get any information back regarding this. He has now returned to the UK, and had kept this all very quiet from us and the rest of his family so I am worried it‚Äôs been so long that we really have no hope of finding anything. He contacted his previous place of employment (ALIARSE) to see if they could at least shed some light on what‚Äôs happened to it but has received no response.

Basically I am really after any information anyone has regarding something like this, if you have had a similar experience or have had this happen yourself and what can I do to help him. ¬£80,000 is a lot of money to us and I can‚Äôt just let this slide into oblivion. I am aware there is a good chance that it‚Äôs gone and we‚Äôll never hear anything ever again.

Thanks so much :)",costarica

Medical tourism in CR,"Anyone traveled to Costa Rica for dental or medical procedures? I‚Äôve visited the country twice for vacation and love it there. Plan to go back as often as possible. Right now I am in need of a minor outpatient surgery (carpal tunnel release) and my American doctor wants $10,000. Even with my very expensive insurance it will cost me $4,000. I‚Äôve requested info from a surgeon in San Jose and am waiting for a response. Just curious if anyone has ever had this done in CR or had any idea where to start. Even if the total trip costs me more than $4k it‚Äôd almost be worth it just on principal because I‚Äôm fed up with this shithole medical system in the US.",costarica
Warning for drivers - Monteverde to Liberia,"I'm going to make myself look stupid here in an attempt to help future travelers. 

If you're driving from Monteverde to Liberia (or any points in that direction) be VERY CAREFUL which route you take. 

The most direct route, suggested by Google Maps, is NOT PASSABLE if you don't have a 4WD with high clearance. It takes you down 606 to start, but eventually splits off to take you through Candelaria, after which you're directed onto an unnamed gravel road. 

Everything is fine at first (if bumpy). Soon, though, the road starts to deteriorate - and to point steeply uphill. Do not attempt this in a sedan, as we just did. Before long, unless you are incredibly lucky, you will probably lose traction, get hung up on a rock, or leave the road entirely. We did the first two, and barely avoided the third. Eventually we reached a point, in the middle of a steep hill, where we simply couldn't continue. 

Thankfully, a local in a Suzuki 4x4 happened upon us, and I sheepishly explained (in terrible Spanglish) what had happened - which was, I'm sure, entirely unnecessary. He had a rope in his car, and very slowly helped to tow us over the crest of the hill - and the next one. After that point we were ""fine"" - still rattling our fillings out, but mostly pointed downhill. 

If not for him, we might have been stuck there for hours. It was extremely windy, and starting to rain. If we'd left later in the day and got caught after dark, it would have been a legitimately scary (instead of just embarrassing) situation. 

I know it was our own stupid oversight, and I take full responsibility as a humbled tourist. I will add - another couple came along while we were stuck in some kind of Subaru AWD, and they just BARELY made it up the hill. That section of road is uniquely bad, and should be avoided by just about everyone - there are much better alternatives. 

I will also add: I've driven the road to Drake Bay in a rental car, rivers and all. This was worse. 

You're welcome, future similarly-naive travelers. Be careful out there.",costarica

Does anyone have any recommendations of must sees around that area? We also will have a car, so can drive a couple hours as well to see 'must see' places. 

In addition, I was wondering if anyone had any restaurant or places to eat and drink suggestions in La Fortuna or Nuevo Arenal.

Question about Gallo Pinto,"Hola redditors de Costa Rica

Because international travel is so difficult now my girlfriend and I have been traveling via our kitchen. Every week we pick a random country, try to find its national dish and recreate it for ourselves. We like national dishes because they tend to be simpler with more accessible ingredients. This week is Costa Rica week and google suggests we make Gallo Pinto. Just a few questions about the dish.

&#x200B;

1. Would you agree that this is indeed representative of a national dish for your country?
2. If not what alternative would you suggest?
3. The recipe for it that shows up the most on Google would be the one here [https://stripedspatula.com/gallo-pinto/](https://stripedspatula.com/gallo-pinto/) Would this be an accurate recipe in your opinion?
4. Is there any alternative to Salsa Lizano? A bottle of this is hard to find in my country and expensive. Will keep looking for it but it would be good to find an alternative if there is one.

Trabajar para una startup EEUU sin emigrar (y ganar en dolares)," 

**TL;DR:** cree un portal de empleos para candidatos latinoamericanos que quieren trabajar remotamente para empresas estadounidenses y cobrar mejores sueldos y en USD. Armamos todo el proyecto entre dos personas ‚Äì pagina web, ventas, sourcing, dise√±o, redes sociales, partnerships, funding, todo. Les cuento como funciona y como lo armamos.

Lanzamos hace unas semanas. Tenemos b√∫squedas publicadas, entrevistas en proceso y varias personas ya consiguieron empleos (y pasaron a cobrar 2x 3x lo que cobraban en sus paises - **USD 15k, USD 25k y USD 45k** son los sueldos que consiguieron).

*Espero que no sea considerado auto-promocion. Lo publique recientemente en* r/vzla *y* r/argentina *y la reacci√≥n fue*[ increiblemente positiva](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/npbjf5/trabajos_en_dolares_para_profesionales_y/h06ti2a/?context=3)*. No tengo nada para venderles a los redditors y se me ocurre que puede ser interesante para residentes de Costa Rica tambi√©n.*

* Link al [job board](http://jobs.hirewithnear.com/).
* Link a un[ tweet que se hizo semi-viral](https://twitter.com/frandpereyra/status/1381024367417638914?s=20) en el que explicaba la idea cuando lanzamos para Argentina.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Cree una plataforma para ayudar a estudiantes y profesionales de paises de Latinoamerica a encontrar mejores trabajos en startups estadounidenses.

Creamos un negocio en 2 meses con un compa√±ero, 100% bootstraped (trabajamos no menos de 12 horas por dia je).

Les cuento la idea porque a mas de uno le va a interesar y tambien me encantaria recibir feedback - criticas y preguntas son muy bienvenidas.

# Como surgio la idea?

Hace unos meses que estoy trabajando en un Venture Studio en EEUU.

Funciona perfecto para ambas partes ‚Äì me pagan el doble de lo que yo cobraba aca (hint: tenia un buen trabajo, finanzas, en empresa de software multinacional pre IPO) y a la vez me pagan menos de lo que le pagar√≠an a un americano con calificaci√≥n similar a la mia. Win-win.

Asique decidimos crear una plataforma para que otros latinoamericanos puedan hacer lo mismo.

# Que es el producto?

Se llama **Near** y es simple ‚Äì es un job board o portal de empleos.

Empresas de Estados Unidos (exclusivamente), en su mayoria startups y SMBs, publican busquedas laborales. Y candidatos de paises de Latam (exclusivamente) pueden postularse y conseguir trabajos son sueldos en dolares.

# Que tipos de posiciones hay?

Finance, sales, accounting, operations, software development, marketing y HR.

Por ejemplo tenemos estas publicadas ahora:

[UI Developer - USD 50k a 80k + equity](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/396/ui-developer/)

[Financial Accounting Analyst - USD 20k - 30k](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/447/financial-due-diligence-accounting-analyst-ecommerce-and-technology-focus/)

[Senior Unity Engineer - USD 40k](https://jobs.hirewithnear.com/job/376/senior-unity-engineer/)

# Como hago para cobrar el sueldo?

Depende de lo que cada uno decida, las empresas dan mucha flexibilidad en cuanto a este tema. Y nosotros nos encargamos de guiar un poco a quienes no tengan conocimiento sobre herramientas para pagos internacionales.

Ademas tenemos un partnership con una empresa que se llama Deel.

El producto de esta empresa es una plataforma (una wallet pr√°cticamente) donde empleador paga con su medio de pago de preferencia (tarjeta de credito, bank transfer, etc...) y empleado decide hacia donde retirar los fondos y en que proporcion, ej: 30% en **BTC** a una crypto wallet, 20% a mi cuenta bancaria en el Bank of America, 25% a mi cuenta bancaria local en Colombia para pagar mis cuentas y 25% a mi cuenta de Wise/Paypal.

# Como funciona la parte legal de trabajar/contratar a alguien en otro pais?

Por lo general se hace un contrato de contratista independiente. Esto quiere decir que te pagan el sueldo **full** (sin deducciones) y luego vos te encargas de pagar tus impuestos, seguridad social y plan de salud en tu pais de residencia. Suele ser la mejor alternativa ‚Äì la que mas $$$ deja en tu cuenta cada mes.

# Near se queda un % de mi sueldo? Cual es su modelo de negocios?

Las empresas nos pagan por postear sus busquedas laborales en[ jobs.hirewithnear.com](http://jobs.hirewithnear.com/) \- no nos quedamos ningun % del sueldo que cada uno arregle.

Les cobramos un monto fijo por job post.

# Hay un sueldo minimo?

Es algo que estamos trabajando en implementar. Aun no hay un estandar de mercado, por lo que vamos observando los sueldos que se cierran en cada iteracion y analizando esa data.

El sueldo m√≠nimo que fijamos inicialmente es de USD 20.000 ‚Äì es decir que todas las posiciones publicadas en Near (desde el 25/05/2021 en adelante) no pueden ofrecer una remuneraci√≥n menor a ese numero.

De todos modos, muchos candidatos han conseguido sueldos mucho mayores (USD 25k, 35k, 55k y 80k a la fecha).

# Hay alg√∫n requisito especial para poder aplicar?

Nivel de ingles suficiente para poder trabajar en una empresa con gente que no habla espa√±ol.

# En que esta armada la plataforma?

Actualmente estamos migrando a[ bubble.io](https://bubble.io/) (muy recomendado para los que les interese la movida low-code).

Basically, I get stopped at one of these road controls. There are 4/5 cops there looking in vehicles and checking paperwork etc. I'm alone in the car as I'm traveling solo.

I have a minuscule amount of Caribbean tobacco in the car (literally minuscule, not even one joint worth), it wasn't hidden at all and I knew they'd find it if they searched. The one that I assume spoke the best English ""took care of me"" and asked me to answer honestly if I have anything in the car.

From my research I knew the law is ambiguous about carrying ""very small amounts"" and that in theory, I'd be fine, so I wasn't really worried when I said I did and handed it over.

But then he started pulling all these intimidation moves on me, ""we're gonna have to take you to the station"", ""do you have a lawyer? You'll need one"" and so on. 

Spends 5min searching through my stuff and asking if I have more, I don't. 

Eventually, he's like ""you'll have to pay the fine at the station"" etc, but switches to ""do you have any money on you?"" (He knew I did, he searched my wallet..).

I check my wallet and count what I got, 6x 10k colones bills. He goes ""well you can pay the fine here"". At this point I got the message, handed him the bills, they went straight to his pocket and then he told me I'm free to go.

Moving to From the U.S to Costa Rica,"Hi guys,
So my parents are both over 70 and were originally planning on selling their small business and finally retiring sometime in the next year. Unfortunately, the current COVID-19 situation has completely wrecked havoc on their lives and destroyed any chances of them being able to retire in the U.S anytime soon. In the last year, they lost a lot of their savings trying to keep their business afloat and having to pay for ridiculously expensive medical bills. Sadly this means that if they want to retire, they won't be able to keep their house in California and continue to pay for medical insurance. 

Recently, I've been exploring other feasible retirement options for them. My parents adore Costa Rica and we typically spend around a month a year vacationing in the small town of Manzanillo within the Lim√≥n Province. I've looked into it and they'd definitely be able to afford to live comfortably in CR off of their pensions. So I was wondering how difficult it is to gain citizenship or a permit resident visa? Also, if my parents are about to get citizenship/visa - would they be able to access the public medical system there? How is the medical system compared to the U.S? Any other tips or advice? 

Lastly, any advice about buying property in CR? Are there any redflags that we should watch out for when searching for properties?

If my parents end up retiring over there, I'd probably end up moving abroad as well. So, I'm also interested in the public school system over there?

Moving back to Costa Rica,"My fiance and I have decided to look into selling our house in the southern US and moving to Costa Rica with our daughter (1yr old) for various reasons.

We've both worked within the tech industry for almost 10 years, but are open to transitioning fields. She is fluent in Spanish (of course), whereas I am still learning. 

Can anyone recommend any areas for a family looking to settle down? Good schools for the little one, and potential employment opportunities are the main goals. 

Any and all information, tips, etc is greatly appreciated.

Help needed! I want to live in Costa Rica for a month‚Ä¶how and where do I do it?,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm recently divorced, have a job I can work anywhere with internet and I really need a little sabbatical after this last year I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve always wanted to do it and I‚Äôll never have another opportunity like this I don‚Äôt believe, so help me make it happen.

I‚Äôm on a month to month lease and my landlords are happy to freeze my rent for a month so that can go toward housing down there. The big question is where is the best place to do it? I‚Äôm probably looking to spend around $1500 for housing, if I can find something cheaper then obviously, rock on. I would be willing to spend a bit more, maybe $2,000 if it made a big difference.

Despu√©s de su desaparici√≥n me enter√© que en realidad no sab√≠a nada de √©l y llevaba una vida algo secreta. De hecho quien me dijo era su familia, result√≥ no serlo‚Ä¶ 
Todav√≠a sigue desaparecido y la esperanza de que alg√∫n d√≠a lo encuentren se desvaneci√≥ hace muchos a√±os. A veces tambi√©n pienso que simplemente quiso desaparecer y comenzar una vida nueva.

Creo que escribo esto ac√° porque estoy segura de que mis amigas se cansan de escuchar sobre el tema y no poder hacer nada que me haga sentir mejor. Prefiero no ponerlas en esa posici√≥n.

Hay canciones que sol√≠a escuchar en esa √©poca que hoy en d√≠a son innombrables por lo que me hacen sentir ya que me llevan directo a los d√≠as que √©l estaba.

&#x200B;

* Est√° confirmado que el grupo Conti ha lanzado una alerta contra instituciones de gobierno y privadas en Costa Rica y Latinoam√©rica en general.
* Esto viene muy de la mano de la creciente escalada de ciberataques derivados del conflicto Ukrania - Rusia y que el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Joe Biden alerto a todo el sector privado en USA el pasado 21 de marzo en el siguiente comunicado: [Statement by President Biden on our Nation‚Äôs Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/statement-by-president-biden-on-our-nations-cybersecurity/)
* Tenemos la tendencia a pensar que bloquear significa protecci√≥n, pero en la ciberseguridad de hoy en adici√≥n a bloquear, la mejor forma de protegerte es estableciendo una cultura de operaci√≥n de ciberseguridad proactiva y que permita determinar si sus organizaci√≥nes est√°n en contacto con infrastructura de los atacantes.
* En particular hay varios tipos de contacto que se ven asociados a ataques posteriores de ransomware y son conocidos como precursores de ransomware. Si sus equipos de computo, redes organizaciones est√°n exhibiento este tipo de contactos, hay que actuar de inmediaro. Esta informaci√≥n la pueden consultar en: [Precursor Malware Is an Early Warning Sign for Ransomware](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-threat-monitor/precursor-malware-is-a-early-warning-sign-for-ransomware)
* Para quienes necesiten apoyo [Lumu](https://lumu.io/es) a trav√©s de su oferta gratuita puede aumentar la visibilidad antes esta situaci√≥n.

Christmas in La Carpio,"As 2020 passes behind us, we look forward to a new year, with new experiences and new hope.  

This year in partnership with #CostaRicanHumanitarianFoundation and Gail Nystrom alongside generous private donors and a GoFundMe : gf.me/u/zb375b which raised over $150, together, near and far, we were able to provide a memorable Christmas Party in LA Carpio, Costa Rica.  

30 Children laughed for the day while being entertained, their bellies weren't grumbling while being feed, and their hearts were bursting with love, joy and happiness.  Communities across the globe came together, to provide a day where the sun beamed down on this community center in LA Carpio. 

Gail shared some stories with me that I'd like to share, there were some mothers in the community center receiving presents that day, when Gail asked a question to the crowd of young mothers, how many of you have never gotten a Christmas present, and all of the young mothers raised their hand.

This year, from that story Gail shared, I'm going to remember, that one small act of kindness, may it be at Christmas time or not, can really change someone..can help their day, their mood, whatever it may be, being kind, caring and compassionate is what is going to help us through 2021, together.

Destination Wedding! (Kinda),"Pura Vida!

So my wife and I recently got married. We are going to have our symbolic ceremony and party in Costa Rica; December of 2023. The issue I'm running into is that half my side of the family lives in Costa Rica (to include my many tios, tias and primos). This is going to make the count of people at our ""Destination"" wedding pretty high compared to others'.  I believe there will be approximately 80 people that come to the wedding. 40 from the states and then my family and friends in Costa Rica. 

My wife and I really want to have the wedding be at an all-inclusive resort that way we can all party for a couple of days, have fun and everyone else can be on their way. The issue i'm running into is that most of the places I am looking at require a certain number of people stay at the hotel. I do not believe any of my family or friends in Costa Rica would want to stay at an all inclusive resort for a couple of days.

My question is; does anyone in this sub have experience with a wedding at any of the nice resorts? If so do you know the costs associated with the entire experience? 

also, Is there a venue or anything I am not thinking of? All my family lives in San Jose/Alajuela so they would have to travel pretty far if I had my wedding in Guana or even La Fortuna.

Also, why would an Internet company irrationally divide their upstream and downstream bandwidth so disproportionately as to stifle any actual utility? Why give me 200 down and only five up? That makes no sense why not 150 down and 50 up? Have they never heard of the pandemic or zoom or Teams or anything that requires upstream bandwidth?

Question to all Costa Ricans.,"To start off I am a Canadian citizen, who has been to Costa Rica last year for the first time and I'm currently here now again. 

I have a question to Costa Ricans.

 Do you find that Costa Rica is an expensive country to live in?

I was talking with my friend here who I have known for about two years, and she told me that many jobs in CR pay less than $1000 USD per month. A quick Google search shows different average salaries ranging from 750USD per month to $1500 per month. 

I find Costa Rica to be on par with Canadian prices in terms of groceries. Cars are also much more expensive here, and gasoline.

Racism / Prejudice Question,"First off, this is not a post to be offensive but just a question because I'm in a new part of Costa Rica I normally don't stay in. I have half Tica siblings but I'm a gringo with beginner to intermediate Spanish. I have been coming here for around 10 years, normally Guanacaste, Escazu, La Fortuna or Atenas. I'm always friendly and thankful type of person.   
I've been in a smaller town for 3 months in the San Jose Province, I think there are maybe 2 gringos in the whole area. Normally when I'm around Ticos it's a great experience, friendly and fun. However, in this town many have been extremely cold, like pissed looking they have to ring me up or upset I'm at their restaurant. If I say hello they say nothing back at all then talk shit after ""Gringo This and that"", like I can hear it, they don't care. 

I guess the question is, are there areas that just really don't like gringos around at all? Like just even before they walk in the door they are prejudice.  Is this Covid related, they don't want foreigners due to it in areas that don't rely on tourism?  We have a lot of racism and prejudice in America so I know it's a person trait and not a whole country. But it has been a super bizarre experience here and I would just like to understand it.

I like to plan everything up front, so I am making a itinerary of things we are planning to do. I'd like to know your thoughts on the itinerary.

Saturday:

Arrive In La Fortuna around 17:00. Check into the hotel. Go out to have dinner and drinks in downtown La Fortuna. Maybe some dancing.

Sunday:

Go on a class III/IV whitewater rafting excursion in the morning (Maybe do combo canyoning excursion as well). Return to hotel and enjoy hot springs pools. Go out to dinner and drink in downtown La Fortuna.

Monday:

Go on a Arenal volcano hiking tour. See the La Fortuna waterfall. Do some ziplining. Enjoy the hot springs pools at hotel and go out to eat in downtown La Fortuna.

&#x200B;

Can you provide recommendations for the following?

1. Favorite restaurants in La Fortuna
2. Hiking trails and ziplining and other site seeing(Such as the waterfall). Also what would be the best order to fit in these activities? Is there a good combo tour that covers all these?

Advice on Transportation Puerto Viejo to San Jose Airport,"Hi All,

Just looking for some advice getting from Puerto Viejo back to San Jose Airport.  All my other transport is good and booked and I went the non rental car route.  I have a 1:30 pm flight out of SJO, I have contacted all the shuttle agencies I found which had 6 am departures but they turned me down because they say I may miss my flight due to construction on the road from Puerto Viejo to San Jose.

I feel like if I leave at 4 or 5 am I should be fine, but they apparently don't want to cut it close with the 6 am.  No shuttle I've found leaves earlier.

Does anyone have any advice on private shuttles or will a cab/uber be able to take me earlier than 6 am?  I'd rather not leave a day early to get a hotel near the airport  as I want to fully enjoy my experience in CR.

What options do folks think are good?  I've read a taxi is around $200 usd, which is fine I don't mind paying.  Maybe I'll get lucky and can carpool with some other tourists I meet, but I won't hold my breath.

Lot we were looking at is in gated community they‚Äôre asking 175,000 for 3 acres which is ocean view.  Is this a bad deal on the land?  Is this a bad idea all together better to just rent when we come down?  Area seemed nice but any locals or people who Have lived there feel otherwise?",costarica

Proposing in Costa Rica,"Hey yall! Planning on taking my girlfriend to costa rica in august/September and proposing there. I do have a couple questions for those who have been there before. I definitely want to take her to Arenal Volcano area to see the rainforest and the hot springs. Then the second half of the trip hit the beach. Im just stuck between staying at Jaco beach or somewhere around Manuel Antonio. Any suggestions as too which is better to stay at? We also have a daughter together who will be 1 y/o around that time so night life and drinking is out of the equation as she will be joining us on the trip.

Second question... Which areas are a more romantic spot to propose? Beach or rainforest/Arenal area?

Questions from a Canadian wanting to move to CR,"
Hi! As the title states, we‚Äôre planning to move to Costa Rica. A group of 5 adults, including my mother which is disabled due to Rheumatoid Arthritis - we hope that being in CR will help with her pain and mobility. 

We‚Äôve been to Costa Rica many times and are quite familiar with the culture, it‚Äôs our favourite thing about the country. The plan is to move in the beginning of 2023, so I‚Äôm trying to do as much research as possible to be as prepared as possible. 

1. Pet food/care: I‚Äôve purchased dog food at the grocery stores to feed to the strays, but I‚Äôm wondering if in the pet stores there are higher quality kibbles? We currently feed Acana (a Canadian brand) so it would be wonderful if there are comparable foods. We also feed raw, like frozen chicken necks and feet - I imagine stuff like that wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to find? Is flea/tick medication especially expensive? How about vet visits?

2. Owner financing: We don‚Äôt have enough money to buy a house outright, we should have around $40k saved and then whatever else we get from selling the contents of our house. I know owner financing is an option and I‚Äôm curious how difficult that is to find? Is there any other options? I‚Äôve read that CR banks are highly unlikely to finance a home purchase for non-residents. 

3. Residency: The purchasing of property worth $200k allows you to apply for permanent residency, but how far reaching is that? Would all 5 of us have to be on the ownership? 

Any and all information/advice is welcomed and greatly appreciated. 3 of us will be driving, my parents will be flying. We have a shipping container that we‚Äôll be shipping with the stuff we intend to bring. My husband and I will also be flying in and renting until we can finalize a purchase, then come back to Canada and begin the full move. 

We own 2 companies that we can run remotely for income, but one of us is hoping to do a conservation internship and get into that field. 

TIA!!",costarica

K√∂lbi is Ripping Me Off,"So because I'm on WiFi most of the time, it took some time to figure out I was being ripped off by them. It wasn't until I started resetting cellular data usage statistics on my iPhone with each 5000 colones purchase, for which I'm supposed to get 4 gigabytes of data, that I realized I was running out before even hitting even 14% of that data usage. I wasn't even at 700 MEGAbytes of my 4 GIGAbyte prepay plan before it shut off my service and said I was out of data.  I'm still trying to get residency so I can use a postpay plan but until then I'm stuck with the Prepay plan.  It doesn't even matter that I enabled the save data feature on the iPhone and only allow certain (very few) apps usage in the background, mainly Signal and WhatsApp. I plan to take my girlfriend with me to the store so she can help me talk to them, I'm becoming fluent in Spanish but in times like these I get too frustrated to be able to speak it well. Has anyone ever had this problem with them? Is it just me or are they ripping everyone off?

They're selling me a 4gb plan for 5 mil, but charging me 25 mil and often more for that. Sometimes I see in their K√∂lbi app, while I'm on WiFi, my balance draining out of my phone. iPhone uses only WiFi data on WiFi, never celular, it's been that way since at least 2012, and this is an iPhone 12 on iOS 14.7.",costarica

Thoughts on Tourists,"Hi all,

I have been working remotely for a few months now, and I have been setting aside money for travel. I live in the United States, and I noticed that Costa Rica has been letting in U.S. citizens for a while.  From my research, it appears as though Costa Rica has been handling COVID quite effectively. The hospitals do not seem to be at capacity, masks are  worn everywhere, and  additional precautions are being taken to protect the public health. Please correct me if I am wrong on any of those points -- in fact, that is solely the reason I am making this post.

For someone living in Costa Rica or anyone with insight to offer, what is the current stance on individuals traveling into Costa Rica? I am considering relocating to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca for a little over a month. I would stay in an apartment by myself and work from home. I would also go to the beach and the gym. I likely will not be in contact with many people, besides the gym and grocery store when a mask is worn. Upon return home to the United States, I will self-quarantine for two weeks and get tested after the quarantine. With that all in mind, should I just stay at home?

Perhaps tangential, but I have been living at my parents house  since April 2020. The combination of the pandemic and living with my parents has recently taken a toll on my health. I have been extremely diligent in staying safe during the pandemic; I have not seen any friends indoors since April 2020. There is much more that factors into this decision, but I don't have the space for that on a Reddit post; feel free to ask me  more about this in the replies... For years I have wanted to live in Costa Rica, and the opportunity is, technically, here. It is a privilege to travel during the pandemic, not a right and I want to ensure I am doing as much as I can to be a responsible traveler (if they even exists right now). I can tell that traveling to Costa Rica is an action that I need to take for my wellbeing, but maybe my ego is interfering with the health of an entire country.

tldr; Although it is currently possible to travel to Costa Rica right now, is this responsible?

Any insight or discussion on this topic is much appreciated,  thank you!",costarica

May I ask a few questions about Costa Rica? My sister moved there last year....,"So my sister and her husband retired and moved to Atenas last year from the USA.  My sister has a habit of exaggerating, so I'm just curious about some of the stories she has told me about Costa Rica.

1. When I asked her why they were moving to CR, she said it was because there is absolutely no crime and no one has guns or weapons.  I really question this, as every place has crime to a certain extent.
2. She said that there is absolutely no place in all of CR to buy a mop, so she has to use a rag and clean the floors on her hands and knees. Really?
3. She said that it is impossible to buy spinach, limes or Cool Whip in all of CR.
4. She said when you buy something in CR that's in a box, the store will remove the item out of the box and they keep the box.  For example, they purchased a microwave in CR.  They said that the store took it out of the box and just handed them the microwave.  When they arrived home they discovered the microwave did not fit in the cabinet opening.  The store would not allow them to return the microwave, since it was out of the box, even with a receipt.
5. She said when you go to the bank, it takes hours every time, even for a simple transaction.  This seems suspect.
6. Here's the real kicker....she is having all her mail sent to me (in Indiana) because she said they have no way to get mail in Costa Rica.  I find this really difficult to believe.  Surely there are expats there that have mailboxes or at least PO boxes.

Can someone please shed some light on all this?  I'm not going to confront my sister about any of this, because it does no good.  She tells the truth some times, but lies so many times that at this point I just don't know what to believe.  My poor mom is upset because she too doesn't know what to believe.  Thank you.",costarica

I have been to Costa Rica once before with family and stayed at an all inclusive resort (Planet Hollywood in Guanacaste). Looking to do a different experience and stay in the towns. It is my cousin and I traveling (both 25M).

We plan to rent a car.

Things I‚Äôd like to see (not ordered in importance):

1. Arenal Volcano
2. Manuel Antonio forest
3. Monteverde
4. Santa Theresa
5. Tamarindo
6. Jaco
7. La fortuna

Obviously I do not have enough time to see all of these over 7 days, but what are 2-3 places that I should pick based on my itinerary/flights and desired activities?

We are both single and looking to party/nightlife, but also want to do outdoorsy stuff: hike, beach, atvs, zip lining, etc.

Open to any suggestions not listed and really appreciate it!",costarica
Going to Santa Teresa tomorrow,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm flying in to San Jose then driving to Santa Teresa on Tuesday through the puntarenas ferry. We‚Äôre going to be there for about a week and was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of stuff to do.

Surfing will be big on the trip, so any certain spots anyone can recommend?

Cabo blanco national park is a cool place I read about and the hike sounds interesting.

Montezuma and the waterfalls seems like a good day trip

Tortuga island? I read a little but wondering if anyone has any thoughts.

Any other recommendations? Maybe rent ATVs and cruise around for a day.

Appreciate any advice and we are all stoked to get out there.",costarica
Real Estate Investment in Costa Rica," 

Hello everyone.

I'm a foreigner who is considering investing in property in Costa Rica.

I'm contemplating: a) where to buy 

b) build home to sell, or buy/renovate existing home and sell)

c) I hear there can be trouble with title deeds. With a lawyer, will it be possible, or will it be a huge risk regardless? Is the lawyer + additional permits and documents very expensive?

d) I've heard the USD is sometimes used. Is that true for real estate, or just small transactions?

Thank you all",costarica

Help me please. 10 day Costa Rica trip.,"What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm looking to do a ten-day Costa Rica trip with my girlfriend and I. We‚Äôve both visited in the past and loved it. We want a potential volcano day But also JetSki, surf, beach, jungle, coffee, culture!

I‚Äôve been to Manuel Antonio and absolutely loved it and it seems like a good spot for everything but volcanoes. Would be willing to do two areas for the trip (obviously necessary to check out volcanoes). What do you guys suggest?

I have heard great experiences in Tamarindo and Nosara but am unsure where to go. Should I do Manuel Antonio again? Any info is appreciated.

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the United Arab Emirates and Costa Rica to encourage tourism interchange,"&#x200B;

The Costa Rican Tourism Institute and the Ministry of Economy have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote tourism cooperation and strengthen bilateral ties. Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade, and Rodolfo Solano, Costa Rica‚Äôs Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship, signed the Memorandum of Understanding. During the signing, Al Zeyoudi stated that the agreement will help boost the UAE‚Äôs reputation as a desirable tourist destination for Costa Ricans and Central Americans, as well as support the country‚Äôs tourism development strategy and future goals, which include increasing tourism‚Äôs contribution to GDP to 15% by 2030 and attracting over 40 million tourists annually.

According to Solano, the two countries‚Äô MoU will improve their tourist businesses and bilateral ties, as well as attract mutual tourism investments. The two countries agreed to strengthen their tourism cooperation, promote tourism-related activities, and increase the number of visitors between them, as well as encourage joint participation in international tourism fairs, conferences, and seminars, promote tourism destinations in both countries, organize mutual flights, and use digital technologies to improve tourism services. They also decided to form an action group made up of relevant authorities from both nations in order to improve their tourist collaboration.

Helping Contain COVID19 - Suggestions,"So, we are a family of four in Cahuita, who through backtracking other family and friends we have had close contact with, believe we may have been exposed or have risk.

We are currently in self-quarantine at a rental and are trying to make the best decision for the greater community about what to do next.  Thinking we could:  
A) Fail to meet certain personal and professional obligations and attempt to extend our stay in relative self-quarantine (still have to go get supplies at a store, not like there is delivery, but we have masks we can use).  This seems a bit risky with the threat of ""indeterminate no return"" with the ""level 4"" travel thingie.

B) Follow the US GOV advice to ""return home now"" and risk exposing others if we have it (and ourselves if we don't) traveling back (again, at least we have ""anti-viral"" masks but they are not N95). 

C) Find a testing option and confirm we are negative before traveling and/or treatment (two of us are slightly elevated risk).

Discussing option C, but we can't seem to figure out if that is possible or how to go about it.  Anyone have information about testing and/or healthcare options in Costa Rica or where to find them?
